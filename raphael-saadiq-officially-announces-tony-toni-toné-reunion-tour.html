Without those who were with us from Day One, where would I be? But the main reason is that my father, Charlie Wiggins, would’ve wanted it this way – to see me, D’Wayne and Tim playing together again.”</p><p><br>Formed by Raphael Saadiq, his brother D’Wayne Wiggins and Timothy Christian Riley in the late 1980s, the trio released their debut album Who? in 1988, followed by The Revival in 1990.</p><p>Tony! Toni! Toné! then achieved stardom with their third effort&nbsp;Sons Of Soul in 1993, which was certified double platinum by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America). The group then disbanded after their fourth effort&nbsp;House Of Music, which critics called their best project.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>In a 2019 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Sway’s Universe</a>, Saadiq revealed the group would be getting back together, despite D’wayne previously saying it would never happen. The Grammy Award-winning singer elaborated on what motivated the change of heart in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>NME</a>&nbsp;later that year.</p><p>“I’ve been working on new Tonys music for about 15 years. I just felt like we should do something, a few songs, maybe seven or eight of them and then do a few shows,” he said. “So I’m not gonna be back-back because I have way too many things going on, but as far as doing a tour and an EP or something, I’m down for that.”</p><p>He continued: “I’d actually like to perform the very last record we did together, ‘House of Music’. We never toured that record so if everyone is up for it I’d like to do that and put out three new records.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2017/05/adrian-marcel-raphael-saadiq-grammy-party-e1494982195878-220x165.jpg alt="Adrian Marcel Recalls Raphael Saadiq Getting Turnt At Clive Davis’ Grammy Party" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Adrian Marcel Recalls Raphael Saadiq Getting Turnt At Clive Davis’ Grammy Party</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>May 16, 2017</p></a><p>He also spoke on Tony! Toni! Toné!’s breakup and the rumors that it was because his brother&nbsp;D’wayne&nbsp;stole money from the group.</p><p>“It was more an appropriation of funds, if you know what I mean?” Raphael Saadiq clarified. “Things just weren’t operating right. We were young, we all really didn’t understand everything and he was sort of the leader of the group. We all had the same bank account at one time.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Tickets for the Just Me & You Tour go on sale to the general public on Friday (June 23) at 10 AM local time, with a special presale starting Wednesday (June 21) at 10 AM local time.</p><p>Check out the full list of dates below:</p><p><strong>SEPTEMBER 2023</strong><br>21 – Birmingham, AL – BJCC Concert Hall<br>22 – Charlotte, NC – Ovens Auditorium<br>24 – Washington, DC – The Theater at MGM National Harbor<br>26 – Baltimore, MD – Lyric Opera House<br>28 – Philadelphia, PA – The Met<br>30 – New York, NY – Radio City Music Hall</p><p><strong>OCTOBER 2023</strong><br>1 – Durham, NC – Durham Performing Arts Center<br>5 – Boston, MA – Orpheum TheatreSun October<br>8 – Cleveland, OH – State Theatre<br>10 – Louisville, KY – Louisville Palace<br>11 – Nashville, TN – Ryman Auditorium<br>12 – Chicago, IL – Chicago Theatre<br>13 – Detroit, MI – Fox Theatre<br>19 – Greensboro, NC – Steven Tanger Center for the Performing Arts<br>20 – Columbia, SC – The Township Auditorium<br>21 – Jacksonville, FL – Moran Theater<br>22 – Atlanta, GA – Fox Theatre<br>26 – Memphis, TN – Orpheum Theatre<br>27 – New Orleans, LA – Orpheum Theatre<br>28 – Dallas, TX – Music Hall at Fair Park<br>29 – Sugar Land, TX – Smart Financial Centre at Sugar Land</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>NOVEMBER 2023</strong><br>10 – Las Vegas, NV – Pearl Concert Theater at Palms Casino Resort<br>11 – Los Angeles, CA – YouTube Theater<br>14 – Oakland, CA – Paramount Theatre<br>17 – San Francisco, CA – The Masonic</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mipmqiYlrKtedKamJ2hoWLBsLrYZquoppliwbC6xGarqK2i</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
