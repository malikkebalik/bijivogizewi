Johnny Quigley, a name synonymous with musical excellence, left an indelible mark on the world of Irish showbands, and his legacy is nothing short of legendary.</p><p>For many, Johnny Quigley’s All Stars stood as the pinnacle of Irish Showbands, a sentiment shared even by luminaries like Brendan Bowyer, of the Royal Showband. During a memorable appearance on the UTV Gerry Kelly Show, when Brendan was asked to name the greatest Showband of all time, he didn’t hesitate for a moment. With unwavering conviction, he proclaimed, “It has to be Johnny Quigley All Stars from Derry.” When pressed further on his choice, Brendan explained that the band was distinguished by its outstanding musicianship, with at least five members who could have fronted any band. Their performances were nothing short of mesmerizing, marked by an infectious enthusiasm and masterful arrangements of the classic hits of their era. It was that night, watching them play in Waterford, that Brendan decided he wanted to be part of a showband, setting in motion a journey that would become history.</p><p>Johnny Quigley was a musical genius, a true son of Derry, and an artist of unparalleled talent. His unique contributions to the world of music will never be forgotten. Johnny’s passing leaves a void that can never truly be filled, and the entire community mourns the loss of this remarkable individual. Rest in peace, Johnny Quigley, you were one of a kind, and your memory will forever resonate in the hearts and minds of those who had the privilege of witnessing your musical genius. You will be profoundly missed, but your legacy will endure for generations to come.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwts6hpaexXabCqrPLnrBmp5Kewbat0bJkpp2dl7Kzec6fZJ2doqfGbrDAp5qeq12drrR5z5qqrJ2UYq64rdho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
