We was thinking about her. This was always a dream of hers that we’d be on stage together like in a big way, in such a global televised event.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/diddy-2023-vmas-performance-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Diddy told his son that he was “proud” of him for nailing their performance. The “Victory” singer also recalled how Christian’s wanted to follow in his dad’s footsteps and be a performer since he was young. “Since he was four years old, he would yell and scream to come on stage with me,” Diddy said. “When I was doing encores, he would yell and scream to come on stage. This is like our third time performing, but like our biggest time when he really, really, really held it down and I’m proud of him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Diddy included his 25-year-old son in his eight minute-long performance with a medley of his greatest hits across his career. The pair sang some of Diddy’s hits from the early 2000s like “Bad Boys For Life.” Diddy also welcomed <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Young Miami</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Keyshia Cole</strong></a> on the stage during his remarkable performance. Afterwards, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mary J.

Diddy shared Christian, D’Lila, and Jessie with Kim, and he also adopted her son <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Quincy</strong></a>, 32, while they were together. Diddy and Kim began their relationship in the ’90s. They broke up in 1999, but later rekindled their romance in 2003. They ended up splitting again in 2007, but they remained close friends and co-parents to their children.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Sadly, Kim was found dead in her home on Nov. 15, 2018 at the age of 47. It was later revealed that she died of lobar pneumonia. Like he did at the VMAs, Diddy has honored Kim in some of his music performance since she passed. When he was honored at the 2022 <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BET Awards</a> with the Lifetime Achievement Award, the rapper sang “I’ll Be Missing You” as <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a tribute to his late ex.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH16e5BsZp2hlJnGbr%2FOp2ScoKKewLW1wKdknKedl8Bufo9ramaunZbAbrzEq52oqp2Wu6SxjJ2cnaGTlsGmsIykoKZloKS%2FtbHRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
