He died on a New Year's eve, Thursday, December 31, 2015, at age 82. The actor was surrounded by family when he died in Los Angeles, CA, of complications from pneumonia, his publicist and longtime friend Rona Menace reported. Rogers' U.S.Army surgeon Trapper John was one of the most beloved characters, and half of one of the most beloved duos, in TV history, despite the actor's appearing in only the first three of the series eleven seasons on CBS-TV. The two skilled doctors blew off steam between surgeries by pulling pranks, romancing nurses and tormenting their tentmate, Frank Burns, always with an endless supply of booze and one-liners at the ready. In one classic moment, Trapper reaches out as though he's checking for rain and says, "Hmm, feels like it's going to martini," as Hawkeye promptly passes him a drink. And in another line that typified the show's ethos, Trapper answers a question with "How should I know? I dropped out of school to become a doctor." Rogers was on "MASH" from 1972 to 1975, becoming one of many original cast members to leave the wildly popular show that lasted until 1983. He was initially considered for Alda's character, but he preferred Trapper's sunnier disposition to Hawkeye's darkly acerbic personality. The characters were essentially equals when the show began, but the series increasingly focused on Alda, which was a factor in Rogers' departure. Two other actors played Trapper in other incarnations. Elliot Gould was the same character in the "MASH" feature film that preceded the TV show, and Pernell Roberts played the title character in the 1980s spinoff television drama "Trapper John, M.D." An Alabama native and Princeton graduate, Rogers had parts on many short-lived shows before "MASH," specializing in westerns such as "Law of the Plainsman" and "Stagecoach West." He had a bit part in the 1967 feature film "Cool Hand Luke" with Paul Newman. In years after "MASH", he returned to TV regularly with a recurring role in the early 1990s on CBS's mystery series "Murder, She Wrote." Rogers moved beyond acting to see success later in life as a money manager and investor. In 1988 and 1990, he appeared as an expert witness before the House Judiciary Committee to speak in favor of maintaining the Glass-Steagall banking act of the 1930s. In recent years he was a regular panelist on the Fox Business News stock investment show "Cashin' In."
