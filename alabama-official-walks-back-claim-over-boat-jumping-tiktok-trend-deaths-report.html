Jim Dennis of the Childresburg Rescue Squad has walked back his original claims that local drownings were tied to the TikTok “boat-jumping” trend.</strong></p><p>An Alabama official claimed that a deadly TikTok trend has killed four people in the past six months — then walked back his remarks days later, alleging that his previous statements were “blown way out of proportion.”</p><p>Jim Dennis, captain of the Childersburg Rescue Squad, is now insisting recent drownings in the area are not linked to a social media phenomenon that encourages daredevils to leap out of speeding boats — despite being quoted as saying so earlier this month.</p><p>“We’ve had four drownings in the last six to eight months (that the Childersburg Rescue Squad worked) and some of those were just drownings,’’ Dennis&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told AL.com Monday</a>, retconning his original claims that risk-takers were breaking their necks trying to take part in the TikTok “boatjumping” stunt.</p><p>“To say that’s the reason they died, I can’t say that. That would be a matter of opinion.”</p><p>“It got blown way out of proportion,’’ Dennis said, adding that there is no data to support his original claims.</p><p>Earlier this month, Dennis told multiple media outlets that several people died after leaping from a boat, only to break their necks on the wake and drown.</p><p>“Last six months we have had four drownings that were easily avoidable. They were doing a TikTok challenge. It’s where you get in a boat going at a high rate of speed, you jump off the side of the boat, don’t dive, you’re jumping off feet first and you just kinda lean into the water,” Dennis <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told WBMA.</a></p><p>He&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told ABC 7:&nbsp;</a>“The four that we responded to when they jumped out of the boat, they literally broke their neck and, you know, basically an instant death … I think people, if they’re being filmed on camera, I think they’re more likely to do something stupid because they want to show off in front of their friends for social media.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The trend — dubbed boat jumping</a> — has been an issue for first responders over the last two years, the captain said, but has especially picked up since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Dennis claimed one man died in February after performing the trick in front of his wife and children, with them capturing his death on camera.</p><p>Despite the tragic end, three others reportedly ignored rescuers’ warnings and succumbed to the same fate.</p><p>But the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said Monday that Dennis’ claims were “incorrect.”</p><p>The state department said that two people were fatally injured after jumping out of a moving vessel in 2020 and 2021, respectively, but that there were no similar deaths on record this year.</p><p>The ALEA told The Post that it has investigated six maritime deaths in 2023, though none occurred in the vicinity of Childersburg, a city roughly 50 miles southeast of Birmingham.</p><p>The nearest drowning occurred after a 32-year-old man “voluntarily enter[ed] the water from a vessel” in a lake nearly 30 miles from Childersburg.</p><p>“The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency’s (ALEA) Marine Patrol Division does not have any record(s) of boating or marine-related fatalities in Alabama that can be directly linked to TikTok or a trend on TikTok,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it said in a statement</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">A TikTok trend, dubbed boat jumping, has killed at least four people in Alabama this year. <span class=credit>nataliejillfit/TikTok</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The trend has been an issue for first responders over the last two years but has especially picked up since the beginning of the year. <span class=credit>nataliejillfit/TikTok</span></figure><p>A TikTok search for “#boatjumping” or any iteration of the two words shows a stream of daredevils&nbsp;of all ages&nbsp;filming the dangerous stunt.</p><p>The high rate of speed of the boat combined with the still water make for a dangerous landing pad that feels similar to concrete.</p><p>If an individual who jumps from a moving boat doesn’t protect their neck and head, they could become permanently paralyzed if not more than likely suffer an instant death.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">A TikTok search for “#boatjumping” or any iteration of the two words shows a stream of daredevils filming their potential brushes with what Dennis called “instant death.” <span class=credit>dayyachtcharters/TikTok</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The high rate of speed of the boat combined with the still water make for a dangerous landing pad that feels similar to concrete. <span class=credit>dayyachtcharters/TikTok</span></figure><p>Dennis — who urged boaters to avoid the deadly trend — now claims that comments were taken out of context during interviews he gave promoting boating safety.</p><p>Dennis told AL.com that in one of the deaths his squad worked on, the victim had jumped from a moving boat and that another died after leaping from a vessel, though there were conflicting statements over whether it had been moving at the time.</p><p>The rescue squad does not get to view coroner reports, so Dennis is unsure what actually attributed to their deaths.</p><p>“If we have a drowning, we may know unofficially what it is but to make an official statement, that would have to come from ALEA. Sometimes it’s a year or two before they get the final coroner’s report,” he said.</p><p>Dennis did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment and a number for the Childersburg Rescue Squad was not in service. It’s Facebook page is also no longer active.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmaXBfl7yiwMmupKmhnpx6tbXKraakZaSnsq%2Bw0maapZmZonp1ecuirZ6rXZ67boKMpqanrJioeqq6jJqjmpqRoq5w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
