In early 2018, the two began dating. Since then, they’ve been regularly Instagramming their relationship. They have never been afraid to publicly express their feelings for each other.</p><p>Brianna recently posted on Instagram, “two years with my best friend I love you forever baby,” as the day seemed to mark their two years of being together. Not to mention the time she wrote to wish her “favorite person” a happy birthday—</p><p>“With you, there is never a dull moment; thank you for making me laugh every day; I adore you.”</p><p>Or when her good-looking 6′ 3′′ hunks lovingly phrased this.</p><p>“Happy twentieth birthday, Queen!! I can’t express how much you mean to me. You are my best friend and the most important person in my life! I can’t wait to celebrate many more birthdays with you! I adore you; let us celebrate right now, baby.”</p><p>Nik Pelligrino is a retired football player. He played collegiate football for the Notre Dame Falcons as a linebacker during his sophomore (2017), junior (2018), and senior (2019) years. Nik grew up in Medina, Ohio, and attended St. Edward High School.</p><h2><span id=Brianna_Chickenfry-_Professional_Career>Brianna Chickenfry- Professional Career</span></h2><p>For those who are unfamiliar with Barstool Sports, it is a digital media company that creates content centered on sports and pop culture.</p><p>So, as surprised as she was about the Barstool gig, she also felt humiliated because they had approached her because of her rising fame on TikTok.</p><p>The humiliation came from the fact that her claim to fame on the platform was a video of her violently puking after a night of body shots at her neighborhood Chinese restaurant. Following the incident, her<strong> TikTok account grew from zero to 290,000 followers</strong> in less than a year.</p><p>So this was the start of her <strong>Barstool internship</strong>, which appeared to have begun in early 2020. In May of that year, while still at Barstool, she expressed skepticism about getting into med school “after making a fool of myself at Barstool all summer.”</p><p>According to glassdoor.com, she was paid between $423 and $457 per month as an intern. However, the paycheck quickly multiplied after the outlet decided to hire her permanently. She was hired as a full-time employee after only a week as an intern.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight>Body Measurements: Height, Weight</span></h2><p>Brianna Chickenfry is <strong>5′ 10′′ tall and weighs less than 53 kg</strong>, according to recent reports. <strong>She also looked stunning in her 34-24-33-inch measurements.</strong></p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>Brianna is active on Instagram under the real name ‘Brianna LaPaglia,’ where she has entertained<strong> 116k followers (until Feb. 19, 2021)</strong>.
