Rev Run is probably best known as the co-founder of a popular hip-hop group from Queens, New York called “Run D.M.C”. Considered to be among the best known hip hop acts in the 1980s, “Run D.M.C” is one of the groups that introduced the new-school genre into the hip hop music. Founded in 1981, the group included Simmons, <a href=#>Darryl McDaniels</a> and Jam Master Jay, who was murdered in 2002 at the age of 37. An award-winning group, “Run D.M.C” has released seven studio albums, one of which, namely “King of Rock” (1985) was the first album to ever receive a Platinum certification. “Run D.M.C” was also the first hip hop group that had their music videos shown on MTV and they were the first ones to be featured on a music-performance show hosted by <a href=#>Dick Clark</a> called “American Bandstand”, as well as the cover of “Rolling Stones” magazine. “Run D.M.C” was named “The Greatest Hip Hop Group of All Time” and in 2009 they were honored by being inducted into the “Rock and Roll Hall of Fame”. It is obvious that “Run D.M.C’s” contribution to the music industry is of great value and importance.</p><h3>Rev Run Net Worth $70 Million</h3><p>A famous disc jockey and rapper, how rich is Rev Run? According to sources, Rev Run’s net worth is estimated to be $70 million. Undoubtedly, the majority of Rev Run’s net worth comes from his involvement in the music industry.</p><p>Joseph Simmons was born in 1964, in Queens, New York. Prior to his mainstream success, Simmons was a part of another rap group entitled “The Force”, yet eventually he founded “Run D.M.C” and focused on making music with this band. Soon afterwards, Simmons became a Pentecostal minister and, as a result, changed his stage name to Rev Run. After the death of Jam Master Jay, the group announced its breakup, and therefore two former members Simmons and <a href=#>Darryl McDaniels</a> went their separate ways. Several years later, in 2005, Simmons released his first solo work entitled “Distortion”, which peaked at #98 on the Pop 100 chart, and had one of the songs, namely “Mind on the Road”, featured on the soundtrack of “Madden NFL 06” video game. That same year Simmons came out with his own reality series called “Run’s House”, which featured his wife <a href=#>Justine Simmons</a>, as well as his daughters and sons. The show was on air for 6 seasons and produced a total of 59 episodes.</p><p>Some of Simmons’ other ventures include the publication of a book called “Take Back Your Family: A Challenge to America’s Parents”, as well as the premiere of two of his newest series entitled “Rev Run’s Sunday Suppers” and “Rev Run’s Renovation”. Both of these shows debuted on screens in 2014.</p><p>A famous rapper, television personality and an author, Rev Run has an estimated net worth of $70 million.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=30.835497835498><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$70 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 14, 1964</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New York, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.73&nbsp;m, 1.73&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Profession</td><td>American disc jockey, rap artist, actor, television producer, hip hop mogul, tv show personality</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Northern Highlands Regional High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Justine Simmons (m. 1994)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Children</td><td>Diggy Simmons, Russell Simmons II, Miley Justine Simmons, Victoria Anne Simmons, Angela Simmons, Vanessa Simmons</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Parents</td><td>Daniel Simmons, Evelyn Simmons, Evelyn Simmons, Daniel Simmons</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Russell Simmons, Daniel Simmons, Jr.</td></tr><tr readability=0.35555555555556><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/RevRunWisdom</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/revrunwisdom</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.42857142857143><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/revwon/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0799807</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Albums</td><td>“King of Rock” (1985), “Raising Hell”, "Distortion", soundtrack: “Madden NFL 06”</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Music Groups</td><td>Run-D.M.C.
