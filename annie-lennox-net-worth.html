She is a musician – singer and songwriter, who was a member of the band The Tourists, but is better known as a member of the duo The Eurhythmics. She is also known for her solo career, as she has released six studio albums, including “Diva”, “Medusa”, “Nostalgia”, etc. Her career has been active since 1976.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Annie Lennox is, as of early 2016? According to sources, it is estimated that the overall size of Annie’s net worth is equal to $45 million. The main source of this amount of money is coming from her successful career as a musician.</p><p><strong>Annie Lennox Net Worth $45 Million</strong></p><p>Annie Lennox was born on Christmas Day to Thomas Allison Lennox and Dorothy. She attended Aberdeen High School for Girls, after which, in the 1970s she enrolled at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where she studied the piano, harpsichord and flute for three years. While there, Annie was a member of several bands, including Windsong. Thanks to her accomplishments during studies, she was made an Honorary Fellow by the academy in 2006, as well as a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in the same year.</p><p>In 1977 she became a singer for the band The Tourists, which was her first collaboration with Dave Stewart. Three years later, The Tourists disbanded, and Lennox and Stewart started their own synth-pop duo, called The Eurhythmics. The duo existed for 10 years, before they decided to go their separate ways, and during that time they released eight albums, such as “In The Garden” (1981), “Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of These” (1983), “1984 (For the Love of Big Brother)” (1984), “Revenge” (1986), “Savage” (1987), and “We Too Are One” (1989). The albums were extremely popular, achieving platinum status several times, which increased Annie`s net worth by a large margin. The albums spawned such single hits as “Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of These)”, “Here Comes the Rain Again”, “”There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)”, “You Have Placed a Chill in My Heart”, “The Miracle of Love”, and numerous others, which reached No. 1 on the US and other charts.</p><p>After the two parted, Annie started a career of her own, so far releasing six studio albums, the sales of which have also added to her net worth. Her first album came out in 1992, entitled “Diva”, reaching platinum status twice with sales of over two million copies. Her second solo album, entitled “Medusa”, was released in 1995, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, and it is her best-selling album so far, with sales of more than six million around the world. It reached double platinum status in the US, UK, and Canada, which increased Annie`s net worth by a large margin.</p><p>After “Medusa”, Annie`s popularity started to decline, however, her albums, including “Bare” (2003), “A Christmas Cornucopia” (2007), and her latest album “Nostalgia” (2014), still reached gold status, increasing further her net worth.Thanks to her successful career, Annie has received several prestigious awards and nominations, including four Grammy awards, and eight Brit awards.</p><p>Speaking about her personal life, Annie Lennox has been married to gynecologist Dr. Mitch Besser since September 2012. Previously, she was married to Radha Raman from 1984 to 1985, and Uri Fruchtmann from 1988 to 2000, with whom she has three children. In free time she works with organizations such as Amnesty International and Greenpeace. Besides that, she founded The SING Campaign, which raises awareness for people who suffer from AIDS.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Trademarks</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Annie Lennox</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$45 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 25, 1954</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, UK</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5′ 9″ (1.75 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Soundtrack, Actress, Music Department</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Royal Academy of Music, Harlaw Academy, I Put a Spell on You, Why, No More “I Love You’s”</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Scottish</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Mitchell Besser (m. 2012), Uri Fruchtmann (m. 1988–2000), Radha Raman (m. 1984–1985), I Put a Spell on You, Why, No More “I Love You’s”</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Tali Lennox, Lola Fruchtmann,</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Thomas Allison Lennox, Dorothy Lennox, I Put a Spell on You, Why, No More “I Love You’s”</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>http://www.facebook.com/annielennox</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/annielennox</a></td></tr><tr><td>Google+</td><td>http://plus.google.com/+annielennox</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>http://www.instagram.com/officialannielennox</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005142</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Academy Award for Best Original Song, Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist, Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video, Brit Award for MasterCard British Album of the Year, Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media, Grammy Award for…</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Eurythmics, The Tourists, I Put a Spell on You, Why, No More “I Love You’s”</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Grammy Award for Album of the Year, Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album, Brit Award for British Single, Brit Award for British Video, MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film, International Viewer’s Choice Award for MTV Europe, Porin Award…</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Edward II, Birth of a Golem, Eurythmics: Peacetour, Party at the Palace, Annie Lennox: Live in Central Park, Eurythmics: Greatest Hits, Revolution, Red Hot and Blue, Hits of the 80’s</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>MTVU Stand In, Women on the Front Line</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=trademarks><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Deep soulful voice</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>An androgynous appearance.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Very short haircut</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=quotes><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>What’s best for the future of Scotland, her population and generations to come? Would breaking away from the UK bring long term benefits, or would the cessation of union be an unmitigated disaster from which there would be no turning back? From my perspective, I think the issue is complex and there is certainly a strong element of risk. Personally, I’m neither a gambler nor soothsayer and my view doesn’t count in any case. One thing I do know is that the decision is not something to be taken lightly, or to be swayed by heady patriotic emotion. It will be taken by the citizens of Scotland themselves, who need to seriously weigh up the pros and cons, as the responsibility lies wholeheartedly upon their shoulders.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>If people like your music you can’t guarantee they’re going to love you.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>On being awarded the OBE: As somewhat of a renegade, it either means I’ve done something terribly right–or they’ve done something terribly wrong. In any case, whatever powers that be have deemed me worthy of such a recognition, I’m getting my fake leopard pillbox hat dusted and ready.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>I love to be individual, to step beyond gender.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Historically, the image of women in pop music has been so totally ornamental – sexual, but predictably so. It’s hard to tell how far women’s individuality has come in the past twenty years. Certainly, if you look at the pop charts as a measuring stick, you’d think it hasn’t come far at all. But women do feel less like victims now than they did twenty years ago. At heart I’m a feminist, but I’m also a feminist for men. Men should be liberated from the roles that are foisted on them also.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>[on being private about her life] What did you expect? I’m human; I feel what anybody else feels. There is a big difference between what I do onstage and what I do in my private life. I don’t put my living room on magazine pages. I’m not intensely private – I talk a great deal about my life and my work – I just don’t play the game to excess.</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The song “Why?” (from her 1992 debut solo album “Diva”) was about her stormy relationship with fellow Eurythmics band member David A.
