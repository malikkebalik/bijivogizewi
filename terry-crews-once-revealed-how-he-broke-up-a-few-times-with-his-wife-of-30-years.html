The actor has had a glittering career with a slew of awesome action and comedy roles. Still, one thing that has continuously endeared him to the hearts of people is his relationship with his wife, Rebecca King-Crews.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a66e97ad2c49cc3dd354af667056ac569957191574986062.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Rebecca King-Crews and Terry Crews backstage during 2019 ESSENCE Festival on July 05, 2019 | Photo: GettyImages</p><p class=dh>For one, Crews didn't get his big acting break until the early 2000s. All that time, he had to be working odd jobs to keep himself afloat. However, there were also some issues that they faced over time.</p><p class=dh>In <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0F3BhonHMM">an interview with Steve Harvey </a>last year, he explained that he engaged in several destructive behaviors – so much so that his wife left him at a point.</p><p class=dh>When asked what he believed was the key to a successful marriage, Terry answered that he and his wife had broken up a few times. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0F3BhonHMM">He said,</a></p><p class=dh>"There were some times when, basically, I wasn't the perfect man. I was a toxic male. It was my way or the highway."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d8622f3c553a139ef26355a65bbabe191501761580312302.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Rebecca King-Crews and Terry Crews attend the MTV EMAs 2019 at FIBES Conference and Exhibition Centre | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>He further added that a lot of the problems had to do with his background. He grew up learning to control everything in his life – including his wife and his family. However, he found that it's impossible to control someone you love. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0F3BhonHMM">He continued,</a></p><p class=dh>"And you know what? She put up with me. I'll be honest with you, she put up, she stood in there, and then there was one day when she was like, 'I'm out.'"</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>Merging Family with Business</strong></p><p class=dh>Terry firmly holds on to the belief that he can't love someone and control them at the same time. Last year, he appeared in an interview with US Weekly, where<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/terry-crews-reveals-the-secret-to-rebecca-king-marriage/> he repeated the same thing. </a>Right words from someone who seems to have seen it all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5739e8ec9001d364d06fea43fbc348b11134601580311736.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Terry Crews poses in the press room during the 72nd Annual Directors Guild Of America Awards at The Ritz Carlton | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>He and Rebecca have five children, although, of all Terry Crews' kids, daughter Azriel <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/05/terry-crews-kids-family-children/>already seems to be working</a> her way into Hollywood as an upcoming singer and actress.</p><p class=dh>There, they celebrated with other members of the Terry Crews' family, including cousins, friends, well-wishers, and the legendary singer, Stevie Wonder himself!</p><p class=dh>He's been hosting the show since 2019, and there are no signs that the show plans to replace him.
