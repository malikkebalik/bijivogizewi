Taylor’s life was defined by their commitment to others, their openness to others, and their generosity.</p><p>Taylor, a native Charlottesvilleian, will forever be remembered as a hero by everyone who had the honor of knowing them. Taylor’s charisma attracted people from all walks of life, and the connections they forged were unrivaled.</p><p>Taylor followed their heart and became a teacher because they wanted to make a difference in the lives of their pupils. They had a wonderful ability to simplify difficult concepts and make them interesting to students of all backgrounds.</p><p>Taylor’s passion for the arts extended beyond the classroom. They frequented art galleries, went to concerts, and developed their own skills as artists. They were quite generous in sharing their love of music and literature with their loved ones. Taylor devoted most of their free time to fighting for social justice and fostering a more just and fair world.</p><p>Others were moved by their kindness and joined the battle for equality as a result. Taylor’s parents, siblings, and extended family members will always cherish the time they spent with them and think of them fondly. They were a pillar of our community, a trusted friend to many, and an inspiring teacher to more.</p><p>Let us commemorate Taylor Crute by honoring their life and the love they gave to the world. Although they are no longer with us in body, they will be with us in spirit for many years to come. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that memorial contributions be given in Taylor’s name to a nonprofit group whose mission aligns with his own.</p><p>There will be a memorial service for Taylor at a later time. Join us as we celebrate the life of this remarkable person and the impact they have left on the world. We shall miss Taylor Crute dearly, but their legacy will live on through the work they did. God grant them eternal rest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZMGixcuoqWaboqrBpnnOm6CtrZGnxm6vx56poquYmrFur8eaqaWnpKmytMLIpaOeZaaWerOx0qKbnqakYrWiv4ydoJ6cXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
