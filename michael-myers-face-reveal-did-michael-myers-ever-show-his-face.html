As many people know, Halloween has a close connection to Star Trek: Myers’ mask is based on William Shatner’s face throughout the series.</p><h2 class=mb-2.5 style=color:#252525 data-private=redact data-wt-guid=50070ee2-8aef-43c1-b8f6-283c00af848c>Who Is Michael Myers?</h2><p class=mb-2.5 style=color:#252525 data-private=redact data-wt-guid=d57313bc-b6a3-4b9a-90c0-9a392800cda7><strong style=color:#252525>The fictional character Michael Myers appears in the Halloween slasher film series.</strong> It was in 1978 that John Carpenter introduced him as a young boy who murdered his elder sister, Judith Myers.

Michael’s face was revealed in the final scene by Tony Moran in their place of him. In addition to 13 films, novels, video games, and several comic books, the character was created by John Carpenter.</p><h2 class=mb-2.5 style=color:#252525 data-private=redact data-wt-guid=35363263-8e99-4b27-8699-2c191e177ae5>When Did Michael Myers reveal His Face?</h2><p class=mb-2.5 style=color:#252525 data-private=redact data-wt-guid=7773e751-34c3-4e67-a874-f80767d40111>In terms of technicality, Michael Myers was unmasked throughout Halloween (2018), but the front of his face was never revealed.
