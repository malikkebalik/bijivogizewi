As a result, my physical, mental and emotional health has rapidly declined. . . .</p><p>“During my recruiting process, I was promised a ‘family’ within this program and a ‘sisterhood’ with my teammates, who would accept me, care for me, and support me. But instead, after I entered as a freshman, I was heartbroken to find the opposite in that I was training in an unhealthy, unsafe, and toxic environment.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Utah gymnast Kara Eaker said in the two years she trained with the Utah gymnastics team, she was a “victim of verbal and emotional abuse.” <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Eaker wrote that instead of being constructively critiqued,&nbsp;she was ridiculed&nbsp;“to the point of tears in front of the whole team.”</p><p>“I was scared to death by the loud and angry outbursts from the coach, ‘What the hell is wrong with you!’ What the f-ck are you doing!’ ‘You better get your sh-t together!’ and ‘Pull your head out of your ass!’” she wrote.</p><p>“The words are so intense and hurtful that it feels like a knife that’s stabbed so deep in my body that there’s no way to pull it out.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Kara Eaker, a two-time gold medalist at the World Championships and alternate for the&nbsp;2020 Olympics, says she was recently diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Eaker added that even texts from the coach “caused a panic attack.” She said she is speaking out “for all the women who can’t because they are mentally debilitated and paralyzed by fear.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I, too, find myself frozen in moments when fear takes over. But I can no longer stand by while perpetrators are still allowed in sports and are causing young girls and women to suffer,” she wrote.</p><p>An investigation was recently completed into Farden and the culture of the&nbsp;women’s gymnastics program, which found that Farden “did not engage in any severe, pervasive or egregious acts of emotional or verbal abuse of student-athletes,” nor did he “engage in any acts of physical abuse, emotional abuse or harassment.” However, it was found he did make “personally degrading comments.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Kara Eaker wrote that she was promised a family within the program and a sisterhood with teammates, but instead, she was met with nothing but a toxic environment. <span class=credit>Icon Sportswire via Getty Images</span></figure><p>“Despite these findings, we note that a majority of student-athletes interviewed, two-thirds of the student-athletes who participated on the 2022-23 Women’s Gymnastics Team, and all but one current or former staff member affiliated with the Women’s Gymnastics Program described Coach Farden as a caring, passionate coach and did not report any concerns related to the treatment of student-athletes,”&nbsp;the university said in their investigation.</p><p>Eaker called the investigation report “incomplete at best,” saying it has no credibility, because it “omits crucial evidence and information.”</p><p>The University of Utah did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts or are experiencing a mental health crisis and live in New York City, you can call 1-888-NYC-WELL for free and confidential crisis counseling.
