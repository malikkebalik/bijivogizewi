The chorus sets the tone, with DDG proclaiming that he is on a whole ‘nother level, completely geekin’. It’s a statement of self-assurance and determination to succeed.</p><p>In the verses, DDG delves into his journey as an artist and his rise to fame. He talks about having the game in his pocket, with rap just being an option for him. This line reflects his talent and versatility as an artist, suggesting that he has many avenues to explore outside of music.</p><p>DDG also mentions his love for fashion and luxury, with references to taking trips to Milan and his addiction to dressing well. These lines showcase his appreciation for the finer things in life and his ability to make money and level up his lifestyle.</p><p>But beyond the flexing and bravado, “I’m Geekin” also touches on the haters and doubters that come with success. DDG acknowledges that there are those who think they can compete with him, but he dismisses them as simply “tweaking.” He’s ready for war and needs no justification for his success.</p><p>The song’s title, “I’m Geekin,” is a slang term that signifies being high on something, usually drugs. However, in this context, DDG uses it metaphorically to describe his elevated state of success and confidence. It’s a way of saying that he is fully immersed in his grind and focused on his goals.</p><p>Overall, “I’m Geekin” is a powerful anthem of self-belief and motivation. It’s a reminder that success is not a destination but a continuous journey. DDG’s lyrics and delivery are filled with passion and conviction, inspiring listeners to chase their dreams and embrace their own unique paths.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Additional_Information></span>Additional Information:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><strong>Album title:</strong> Maybe It’s Me… (2023)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/web.archive.org/web/20230623135926im_/images.genius.com/33ad330533caa8b97a704fff0fa63511.1000x667x1.webp alt="Image description" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><ul><li>Produced By Earl on the Beat, Beats By Bangs & Tom Levesque</li><li>Written By DDG & Earl on the Beat</li><li>Mixing Engineer Ya Boy N.O.I.S. & Curtis “Sircut” Bye</li><li>Mastering Engineer Nicolas de Porcel</li><li>Assistant Mixing Engineer Brandon Blatz</li><li>Assistant Mastering Engineer Demitrius Lewis II</li><li>Video Director LewisYouNasty</li><li>Distributor Epic Records & Sony Music Entertainment</li><li>Copyright ℗ DDG Entertainment, Epic Records & Sony Music Entertainment</li><li>Release Date April 21, 2023</li></ul><p><strong>Tags:</strong> Rap, Trap</p><p>Remixes: I’m Geekin (Remix) by DDG (Ft.
