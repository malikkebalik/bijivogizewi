With Tiki Barber moving to afternoons, Sal Licata will succeed Barber as Brandon Tierney’s partner from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays, The Post has learned.
Licata, 43, had been doing overnights.
He is expected to continue his SNY nightly work and his weekly spot on Jimmy Traina’s “Sports Illustrated Media Podcast.”
As The Post previously reported, Barber is joining Evan Roberts in afternoon drive."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It has nothing to do with Evan Roberts, nothing to do with anyone here,” Carton said of his decision on June 15. “It has to do with my personal life and the opportunity I have to do a show at Fox Sports and FS1.

I’m a 30-plus year talk show host and radio is the only thing I’ve ever done well.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-19-at-9.36.41-PM.png><p>The move to Fox Sports comes with a seven-figure deal, according to sources, as well as a simplified schedule for Carton, who said he was getting up at 2:30 in the morning for his FS1 morning show, followed by his WFAN co-hosting duties.</p><p>He said he’s focused on being a better father while also patching things up with his wife after having gone to prison for fraud.</p><p>“When I got in my self-inflicted trouble, that led me to resign from WFAN, I was separated from my wife,” Carton revealed. “For three years, literally the day after I got arrested, I did not live with my family. I did not see my children on a daily basis. As I laid in that bed as nothing more than a number, in addition to dreaming about restarting a professional career, the dream was, how do I restart the connection with my family?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/tiki-barber-carton-replacement-wfan.jpg><p>Former “Entourage” star Jerry Ferrara was considered to replace Carton after having impressed filling in for a show with Roberts.</p><p>Instead, Barber will replace Carton, and the ex-Giant’s old role will go to Licata, who can now start his WFAN duties much earlier in the day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29manFfqK6tecuimpqskWLBorfIp55mrJmgtm6uwKuZnqqjYsSnrc1mqqWnpGKup8DEq2ScqpGetG6vwKurqKZdmbKxrdGtrKudXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
