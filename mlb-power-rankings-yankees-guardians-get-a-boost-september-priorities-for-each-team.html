Welcome to September, the month when everything seems a little more important. The pennant races. The awards races. The part of the season where even the fan interference calls become central parts of the narrative.
This week’s power rankings are focused on all things September — the postseason chase, the callups, the expanded rosters, the goals for each individual organization.

The most intriguing division race appears to be in the American League West, where the Mariners, Rangers and Astros are engaged in a three-team battle royale."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The club poses a terrifying matchup for any opposing pitching staff: Atlanta leads the sport in batting average, on-base percentage and slugging percentage.

Fair enough — most of the enlightened teams don’t worry about deciding upon a Proven Closer, preferring to trust the manager to match up his relievers properly on a given night. But Brandon Hyde does need to figure out which of his other relievers he can trust. Can rookie DL Hall handle high leverage? Will <a class=ath_autolink data-id=5yJtiEBS12QOXrSv href=#>Shintaro Fujinami</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=SbUnOR7XPpt8P9Gb href=#>Cionel Pérez</a> keep throwing strikes? The team even claimed its former closer, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=rgoJeeHURzaTUhzz href=#>Jorge López</a>, off waivers to help the group in September.

Apparently, he’s the hottest hitter on the planet. I was looking at season stats; that’s on me. But Hernández is the perfect player to describe the second-half Mariners, who<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> have been the second-best pitching team </a>and the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> second-best hitting team in baseball</a> since the All-Star break.

Every contending team needs to stay healthy.</p><p>Except the Astros are <a href=#>expecting a lot from a 40-year-old ace</a>. They’ve recently welcomed Michael Brantley back, and he’s 36 and notoriously hard to keep healthy. José Urquidy is just getting back into action after being out since April. Jose Altuve has played in only two full months this season. There are a lot of paths to postseason success.

In his next 26 games, Turner hit .362 with 11 homers and nine doubles, providing the speed and spark the Phillies hoped would bolster a lineup already featuring <a class=ath_autolink data-id=9lv6KXk96rZdbNPh href=#>Bryce Harper</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=glotXhPPvld7bPpq href=#>J.T.

He has backslid further this season, with a .746 OPS from May to August. He has dealt with power outages and an odd lack of production at Rogers Centre. But the ability is still there.

As The Athletic’s&nbsp;Jayson Stark <a href=#>pointed out last week</a>, since the start of the wild-card era in 1995, only one team has made the playoffs after being that many games under .500 that late into the season: the 2022 Seattle Mariners. The Mariners, of course, were trying to end an interminable postseason drought. The Cubs’ drought isn’t nearly that long; they grabbed a playoff spot in 2020.

The Guardians recently added reinforcements in starting pitcher <a class=ath_autolink data-id=U7IHH0eiYoo3DamH href=#>Lucas Giolito</a> and relievers <a class=ath_autolink data-id=IwcJepqqq79dddYe href=#>Reynaldo López</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=03Q5RmigOqh2juBr href=#>Matt Moore</a>.

The only pitcher who didn’t get blown up was <a class=ath_autolink data-id=8A4T6SLEptjDWObR href=#>Zach Davies</a>, who is the Zach Daviest of Zach Davieses. The Diamondbacks couldn’t take advantage of the Angels’ cravenness because they were too low in the waiver order, but the rotation is a problem that should have been addressed at the deadline.

Despite a productive offense and a strong season from <a class=ath_autolink data-id=j2gIMX08YciVOzLw href=#>Brayan Bello</a>, the Red Sox are unlikely to appear in October. Chaim Bloom would do well to utilize this final month to sketch out how to assemble a pitching staff good enough to keep Boston afloat in the American League East.

Part of the reason is an excellent rookie season from Pérez, the latest talented arm to emerge from Miami’s minor-league pipeline. The Marlins have managed his workload with care, including a month-long demotion to the minors, which occurred despite his strong results and the allure of a postseason berth. Miami would prefer Pérez avoids the injury-plagued fates that have befallen similar young arms like Sixto Sanchez and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=xOKf7ErCVe520GxY href=#>Trevor Rogers</a>. The Marlins are unlikely to push Pérez, but as long as his arm stays strong, it would be a blast to see him pitch meaningful innings in the season’s final month. — AM&nbsp;</p><p><b>Record: </b><strong>68-69</strong><br><b>Last Power Ranking: T-19</b></p><p><strong>Biggest September priority:</strong> Navigate The Martian’s landing</p><p><a class=ath_autolink data-id=CJysrgijolFehzIs href=#>Jasson Domínguez</a> has traversed the minors under significant scrutiny, with hype that has exceeded his actual production at the plate.

The <a class=ath_autolink data-id=111 href=#>Yankees</a> called up Domínguez as part of a youth movement to salvage a lost season.

But if the Guardians are going to do it, it’s likely two things will happen at once: The arrival of Lucas Giolito will boost the rotation, and a beleaguered offense — which ranks 27th in the majors in combined OPS — will start bashing the ball around the yard for a couple weeks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Will it happen?

A second-round pick in 2018 out of Grayson High School in Loganville, Ga., Meadows projects as a possible long-term answer in the Tigers’ outfield. He provides athleticism in center field and speed on the base paths. But the Detroit brass should get an extended chance to evaluate him at the plate this month. — RD</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><b>Record: 63-74</b><br><b>Last Power Ranking: 24</b></p><p><strong>Biggest September priority:</strong> Enjoy <a class=ath_autolink data-id=fw92vY1VRY72DXFZ href=#>Francisco Lindor</a>’s 30-30 chase</p><p><span>It’s been a brutal year in Queens. The most expensive team in baseball history flopped. The mid-summer teardown was a bummer. And there will likely be more change to come this winter. The disappointment has obscured another strong season from Lindor, who hit his 25th homer on Saturday to make him a member of the 25-25 club. Five homers and five steals would put a nice round number on his campaign. He would become the first Met to achieve this milestone since David Wright hit 30 homers and swiped 34 bags in 2007. It’s not exactly the same as Ronald Acuña Jr.’s remarkable output, but it’s still quite good. — AM</span></p><p><b>Record: 63-74</b><br><b>Last Power Ranking: 25</b></p><p><strong>Biggest September priority:</strong> Look to the future</p><p>No. 1 overall pick <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ZgH3Kou7rn52UPZz href=#>Paul Skenes</a> is making starts in the minor leagues. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=L5CE8gK2Tg1qgRRZ href=#>Miguel Andújar</a> — once a runner-up to Shohei Ohtani in the AL Rookie of the Year voting — is getting at-bats in the major leagues. The standings don’t matter, but the future is coming, and the Pirates have the opportunity to experiment this month as they wait for a crop of young prospects to arrive. Andújar is as good an experiment as any. He once seemed to be part of the future in the Bronx before injuries and ineffectiveness expedited his departure. Andújar crushed pitching at Triple A this season, but it’s been a while since he’s produced in the major leagues. Maybe he can get back on track this month. – RD</p><p><b>Record: 62-76</b><br><b>Last Power Ranking: 22</b></p><p><strong>Biggest September priority:</strong> Finish with a better record than San Diego</p><p>We know, we know.

They don’t really do that in St. Louis. The losing this season has been a shock to the system, but there’s always next year, and Cardinals president of baseball operations John Mozeliak has emphasized that starting pitching will be a priority moving forward. The Cardinals could look to move some of their excess position-player depth. They could dip their toe into free agency. There are options. But one thing is clear: St. Louis’ pitching staff entered Sunday ranked 25th in ERA, and things have to be better than that. — RD&nbsp;</p><p><b>Record: 53-84</b><br><b>Last Power Ranking: 27</b></p><p><strong>Biggest September priority:</strong> Sort out the plan moving forward</p><p>In his first comments as the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=98 href=#>White Sox</a>’s new general manager, Chris Getz talked about increasing the “intellectual firepower” in the front office and building out the depth and balance on the roster. The White Sox finished 81-81 last season and are flirting with 100 losses in 2023. But they do have one advantage as they consider their long-term plans: They play in the AL Central — a relevant fact Getz mentioned in his first press conference.

John Fisher is a modern-day Ganondorf, seeking to destroy all that is good and pure for no reason other than he can, but the players are real human beings. The A’s actually passed the Royals in the standings on Sunday. If they can hold them off in the final month, the team should take some satisfaction from it.
