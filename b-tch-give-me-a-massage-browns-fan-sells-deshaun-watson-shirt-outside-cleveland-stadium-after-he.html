The decision comes after an appeal from the NFL and a settlement between the league and its players association.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>When the Browns visit the Houston Texans, Watson will get a chance to play in his first NFL game. Deshaun Watson of the Cleveland Browns is suspended without pay for the first 11 games of the 2022 regular season.</p><p>Along with the ban, Watson will be fined $5 million for violations of the NFL’s Personal Conduct Policy.</p><p>Besides the punishments, Watson will also undergo a professional evaluation by behavioural experts and a treatment program. The NFL and the NFLPA together agreed on the above terms.</p><h4><strong>Fine With A Purpose</strong></h4><p>Watson’s fine, along with $1 million contributions from the NFL and the Browns, each, will create a fund of $7 million. The proceeds from the fund will be used to support the work of non-profit organisations across the country that educate young people on healthy relationships, promote education and prevention of sexual misconduct and assault, support survivors, and related causes.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Commissioner Roger Goodell stated:</p><p>Deshaun has committed to doing the hard work on himself that is necessary for his return to the NFL. This settlement requires compliance with a professional evaluation and treatment plan, a significant fine, and a more substantial suspension. We are grateful to Judge Robinson and Peter Harvey for their efforts in addressing these matters, which laid the foundation for reaching this conclusion.</p><h4><strong>How It All Started</strong></h4><p>The Watson trial started on August 1, when Judge Sue L. Robinson, the independent Disciplinary Officer jointly appointed by the NFL and NFLPA, found that Watson violated the NFL’s Personal Conduct Policy on multiple occasions. Following that, she suspended him for six games.</p><p>The CBA affords the NFL or NFLPA the right to appeal the discipline imposed by the Disciplinary Officer. The 11-game ban announcement concludes the process, and there will now be no further rulings or additional legal steps.</p><p>Watson’s suspension will likely affect the final roster cut-down and he will be eligible for reinstatement on November 28.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel="noopener noreferrer">After failure in Zimbabwe, K.L Rahul might not be sure-shot opener for India in T20 World Cup!</a></strong></p><p>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Recommended: <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">Sports Fan App</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrAsbvRraqgqpGeuW%2BvzqZmm6yTnXqotdWeZKadXZZ6rq3SrJignV2Xv7DDzaxkn5meYsCmuMusZJ2do52utrqMsJitq5%2BjerS0yKurZqelqcCqsMRmmqWdppq5orrDZqqtmZSewq55wJ%2BrnqpdnbK0ecGapaedlGKzsL6Mamhmn5GisrR5wbJkraCVYrunuIyipWasmJp6c3yRa2SsnZGovK97</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
