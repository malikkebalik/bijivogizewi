Effectively producing foamy lather and providing an elated shaving experience is all in the hands of the shaving bowl you use.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Features of a Good Shaving Bowl</span></h3><h4><b>Material</b></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Shaving bowls are manufactured in a variety of materials, the most popular being plastic, metal, wood, and ceramic. While plastic and metal take a long time to produce foamy lather due to their smooth surfaces, wooden shaving bowls are often disregarded due to their ability to absorb water over time, making your lather dry. Ceramic shaving bowls, however, not only feature a ridged surface for foamy lather but are also easy to clean and can be heated if you’re a fan of warm shaves. While the benefits of ceramic bowls tower over their counterparts, the only downside is that ceramic is easily breakable and can crack if not handled with extreme care.</span></p><h4><b>Bowl size</b></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>To whip foamy and smooth lather, a large bowl is necessary to incorporate effective hand motions. The ideal bowl size should be at least 8 cm across and 5 cm in depth in order to whip your lather without hitting your knuckles on the side. A bowl that is too shallow would cause the soap to flow out of your bowl and ruin your shaving experience. Further, a bowl with a small opening wouldn’t allow effective hand motions, making it difficult to swirl the soap and increasing the time taken to generate the perfect foamy lather.</span></p><h4><b>Design</b></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>The design of a good shaving bowl should be one that takes into consideration the practical aspect of using the bowl. It’s always advisable to get a bowl equipped with ridges at the bottom so that your shaving bowl doesn’t slide off the slippery counter space. Further, if you’re a clumsy shaver, maybe a shaving mug with an incorporated handle would be a better bet for you. Similarly, if you want to avoid making a mess, you can try to find a bowl that features a brush holder for your soapy <a href=#>shaving brush</a>.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>How to Use a Shaving Bowl</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>To use a shaving bowl, wet your brush with warm or cold water (as you prefer) and apply some <a href=#>shaving soap</a> or cream onto your brush. Alternatively, if you’re using a shaving puck, just rub the brush over your puck and get a good amount of shaving soap on it. Next, swirl your brush around your shaving bowl and add in drops of water if needed until you get a rich foamy and smooth lather consistency.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Metal vs Ceramic Shaving Bowls</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>While there are some metal shaving bowls featuring ridges and bumps on the inside, the majority have a smooth surface as compared to ceramic, making it difficult to produce a good lather. Moreover, metal shaving bowls cannot be used for a warm shaving experience as they fail to retain heat as effectively as ceramic-made shaving bowls. However, the plus side to using a metal bowl is its unmatchable durability and its cheap price as compared to ceramic shaving bowls.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Shaving Mugs</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Shaving mugs have been manufactured to keep your hands free from soap while lathering your soap or cream. These special shaving bowls resemble <a href=#>coffee mugs</a> but feature a wide opening for easily whipping your soap. Shaving mugs also feature a handle and high sides to prevent you from making a mess during your lathering endeavors. The downside to a shaving mug is its material; ceramic, which can easily be broken or cracked if not handled with care.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Shaving Scuttle</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>A shaving scuttle is basically a weird-looking tea-pot ideal for those who prefer a warm shave. A shaving scuttle has two compartments stacked on top of each other, the bottom one is filled with hot water, and the top one is perfect for placing your shaving puck or soap. The hot water allows you to build a thick and warm lather on top of your shaving puck, keeping your soap warm for multiple passes. Further, your shaving brush can also be dipped in the warm water below to keep your lather and brush wet and hot during the whole shaving experience.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Benefits of a Warm Shave</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Apart from the soothing sensation of warm lather gently rubbing your face, a hot shave can completely elevate your shaving experience. For starters, a warm shave allows you to open up the pores in your face, effectively cleaning out any dirt stuck inside them and making your face look cleaner. Warm water and lather also soften the beard, owing to a smoother and easier shave for those who tend to struggle with stiff stubbles etched in their skin. Further, a warm shave also aids in easily removing in-grown hairs without producing red spots all over your skin. This is due to the warm lather and water opening up your pores, allowing in-grown hairs to be easily plucked out and avoiding any possible skin irritation after your shave.</span></p><h2 class=review-faqs__title>People Also Asked</h2>What is the best material for a shaving bowl?<p><span style=font-weight:400>Each material has its own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to shaving bowls. Generally, any material containing a rough inner surface and the ability to retain heat is perfect for a shaving bowl.</span></p>How long should I swirl my soap inside my shaving bowl?<p><span style=font-weight:400>To produce smooth and foamy lather, you should swirl your soap for at least 30 seconds inside your shaving bowl. You can also add water during your swirling motion to make sure that your lather has a perfect consistency.</span></p>When should I clean my shaving bowl?<p><span style=font-weight:400>The shaving bowl should be cleaned every time you use a new soap in order to remove the scent of the old soap. However, old soap sitting in your shaving bowl is no threat and cannot produce any mold or bacteria because, at the end of the day, it’s soap!</span></p><img width=64 height=64 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HL_social.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <a href=# title="Posts by HollywoodLife Reviews" class="author url fn" rel=author>HollywoodLife Reviews</a> HollywoodLife For over a decade Hollywood Life has been a leading source of celebrity, entertainment, and pop culture news.
