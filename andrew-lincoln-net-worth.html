Andrew Lincoln is a famous actor, who is perhaps best known for his role in the television show called “The Walking Dead”. During his career, Andrew has been nominated for and has won different awards. Some of them include BAFTA Award, Empire Award, People’s Choice Award, Critic’s Choice Television Award. Although Andrew gained the biggest acclaim after he started acting in “The Walking Dead”, he has been working in the movie and television industries for more than 20 years. Andrew is still working on “The Walking Dead” and there is no doubt that after the end of this show, he will receive even more invitations to act in different projects.</p><p>If you consider how rich Andrew Lincoln is, it can be said that Lincoln’s net worth is $8 million. There is no surprise that the main source of this sum of money is Andrew portraying one of the main characters in a worldwide famous television show, ‘The Walking Dead”. Of course, his other appearances have also added to his wealth and there is a high chance that it will become higher, as Andrew still continues his career and now has become well-known and acclaimed.</p><h3>Andrew Lincoln Net Worth $8 Million</h3><p>Andrew attended the Beechen Cliff School, where he had his first experience as an actor. Soon Andrew became more interested in acting and thought seriously about becoming an actor for a living, which is why he decided to continue his studies at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. In 1994 Andrew secured his first role in the television show entitled “Drop the Dead Donkey”. This was just a small role, but one year later he became one of the main characters of the show called “This Life”.</p><p>Andrew worked really hard in order to achieve acclaim and become more recognizable, and subsequently he appeared in such television shows as “The Woman in White”, “Wuthering Heigts”, “Teachers” and others. All these appearances had a huge impact on the growth of Andrew Lincoln’s net worth. In addition, Andrew has also appeared in several movies, for example, “Human Traffic”, “Heartbreaker”, “Love Actually” and “Gangster No.1”. What is more, Lincoln has acted in various plays and worked as a voice actor.</p><p>No doubt from all these activities, Lincoln was cast in his most famous role in 2010 when he received a invitation to portray Rick Grimes in the show entitled “The Walking Dead”. While filming this show Andrew has an opportunity to work with <a href=#>Jon Bernthal</a>, <a href=#>Laurie Holden</a>, <a href=#>Steven Yeun</a>, <a href=#>Lauren Cohan</a>, <a href=#>Scott Wilson</a> and others. The show has become one of the most famous and successful shows of all times, so there is no surprise that it is the main source of Andrew’s net worth. As the show is still airing, there is a high chance that Lincoln will become even more famous and that his net worth will become higher.</p><p>To talk about Lincoln’s personal life, in 2006 he married Gale Anderson and now the couple has two children. All in all, Andrew Lincoln is a very talented personality, who is now one of the most famous television actors. As he is now just 41 years old, he still can achieve a lot and become even more acclaimed among others in the industry. Hopefully, after “The Walking Dead” is over we will be able to see him acting in other successful projects.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=19.589846897663><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Andrew Lincoln</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$8 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 14, 1973</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>England, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 10 in (1.78 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Beechen Cliff School, Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Gael Anderson (m. 2006)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Arthur Clutterbuck, Matilda Clutterbuck</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Richard Clutterbuck</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Andrew Clutterbuck , Andrew James Clutterbuck</td></tr><tr readability=0.2962962962963><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/AndrewLincolnOfficial</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.26923076923077><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/search?q=%23andrewlincoln</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.26470588235294><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/andrewlincoln/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0511088</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Awards</td><td>BAFTA Award, Empire Award, People’s Choice Award, Critic’s Choice Television Award</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Nominations</td><td>People's Choice Award for Favorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy TV Actor, Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series, Empire Award for Best Newcomer, British Academy Television Craft Award for Best New Director - Fiction, Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actor: Fantasy/Sci-Fi, Phoenix Film C...</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Movies</td><td>“The Walking Dead” (2013), “Human Traffic”, “Heartbreaker”, “Love Actually”, “Gangster No.1”</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Drop the Dead Donkey” (1994), "This Life", “The Woman in White”, “Wuthering Heigts”, “Teachers”</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=17.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>I like to think that I've got determination, and I'm fiercely protective of the people I love.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>I would find myself getting deeply distressed if I lived in hindsight all the time.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>3</td><td>Atlanta is an incredibly cool city.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>4</td><td>I don't feel that fear is a good incentive on a film set.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>5</td><td>I spend my working life pretending to be someone else.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>6</td><td>I'm like a magpie.
