The siblings suffered from their weight and were heading to a path of destruction as they munched on junk food together. However, when the time came to lose some weight, they knew it was a journey they would have to do together.&nbsp;</p><p>The trio found it hard to stick to the diet and exercise and as time passed, their relationship was slowly getting affected. They started feeling the strain of sticking to the diet while hidden problems started surfacing. During their weight-loss journey, Clarence happened to cut his ties with the girls but they came back together for the weight-loss journey yet again.</p><p>Brandie was the first one to get approved for the surgery followed by Clarence. Roshanda was the last one to get approved and had a longer journey than the other two. While the trio showed off their weight loss to everyone on Roshanda's birthday, they knew it was not the end for them but just the beginning of changing their life forever.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout their journey with Dr Younan Nowzaradan, the siblings struggled to keep their weight loss going. At first, Roshanda was the one to put on more weight. Dr Nowzaradan advised her to stick to her diet and not give up while hinting that the relationship the siblings shared might be having an underlying effect on their weight gain.&nbsp;</p><p>While the trio disagreed, he became sure about this when Brandie put on nearly 73lbs. He was not happy with the change and even though she assured him she would get on track, he advised the siblings to go and meet a therapist. They finally agreed and the session helped them open the box that was shut for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p>Their therapist, Lola, informed the siblings how important it was for them to stick together as they started the journey together. However, Roshanda revealed she no longer had expectations from anyone apart from herself and God since she had always been disappointed in the past.&nbsp;Hearing this Clarence was not happy. He decided to walk out of the room stating that he did not want to have anything to do with his sisters anymore. Meanwhile, Brandie laughed off the entire situation and had everyone convinced that she was not taking anything seriously.</p><p>The show ended with the siblings going their separate ways and realizing it would be better to be away. Roshanda hinted she would love to have all of them together even though she was managing everything by herself. While it looked like the siblings had made up their mind about staying apart, Lola thought it may not be the best idea.&nbsp;</p><p>She stated that their sibling dynamic plays a crucial role and might emotionally self regulate and have them head back to their old habits. Will Lola be right or will these siblings prove her wrong?</p><p>'My 600-lb Life' airs on Wednesdays at 8 pm ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopalig3F8jKWZZqSZm7Jur8uaqZ6mk5p6s7vSoZinnJFir7OtzZ2gnmWgmr%2Bztc5mmGasn6N6p63MoqOyZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq0tcGloKef</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
