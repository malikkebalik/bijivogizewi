From that point on, they became good friends, and according to Ben, they were "on the same page" from the first time they spoke. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ben-falcone-talks-directing-wife-melissa-mccarthys-love-scene/>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"We love each other, respect each other, and try not to sweat the small stuff.

The ceremony took place in 2005, and they have had a beautiful romance ever since.</p><p class=dh>From that point on, their relationship has kept getting better. In May 2007, the couple welcomed their first child to the world, Vivian. Only three years later, Melissa's second daughter, Georgette, was born.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5d08c5c19748cce217cf95be7b03c417.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Ben Falcone and Melissa McCarthy on March 20, 2017 in Hollywood, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Since both of them are involved in the entertainment industry, they have appeared on camera together more than once. The first time was in an episode of "<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238784?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Gilmore Girls</a>," where Melissa played Sookie St. James, her breakout role, for all of its seven seasons.</p><p class=dh>Ben, on the other hand, appeared in season three in an episode titled "Say Goodnight, Gracie." Apart from that, they had a hilarious scene on "Bridesmaids," which was the first time that the couple acted together in a blockbuster movie.</p><p><h3 class=ih>CAMEOS OF MELISSA MCCARTHY'S KIDS</h3></p><p class=dh>After sharing screen time on "<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024432?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Identity Thief</a>," they wrote their 2014 film "<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2103254?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_4">Tammy</a>." Ben served as the director of the movie, Melissa was the main star, and he made a cameo as the manager of a restaurant who fired Tammy.</p><p class=dh>For their second movie together, "<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2702724/>The Boss</a>," the couple took things to the next level. Not only Ben directed Melissa in the leading role, but their daughters Vivian and Georgette also made cameos.</p><p class=dh>The two have accomplished what many other people in the entertainment industry have failed to do: stay married for 15 years. In a previous interview that Melissa and her husband had with Ellen, they <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jodH1OEWrOY">shared</a> some of their relationship secrets:</p><p class=dh>"Ben is – lovingly – a bit of a super hypochondriac, maybe germophobe. And we may have seven or eight blood pressure cuffs in our home."</p><p><h3 class=ih>TEACHING HER CHILDREN A LESSON</h3></p><p class=dh>Before saying that he would take his own blood pressure as many times as necessary, Melissa's husband claimed that only one was not enough because "what if it's not working right?"</p><p class=dh>Vivian and Georgette are already used to his unusual behavior, so they don't worry about it anymore.</p><p class=dh>Speaking of her daughters, the actress recently confessed that she taught them an <a class="me a" href=#>important lesson</a> on embracing their personalities and goofiness and being comfortable with who they are.</p><p class=dh>Melissa McCarthy <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/melissa-mccarthy-teaches-daughters-embrace-quirks-be-yourself/>said</a> that she loved the fact that her daughters could know who they are and what they like and don't like</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtna21jZ3quscuiqqyZXaKwpK3RrZ%2ByZZ%2BjsKZ50qGYq52UYrGmwMCio6xlnZqyb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
