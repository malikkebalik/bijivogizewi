How could they not? The once ultra-viral 'Shmoney Dance' went from Vine to Beyoncé and Rihanna's hips. Even Drake invited Shmurda on the stage during one of his concerts.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bobby Shmurda Taking One for&nbsp;Rowdy Rebel</h2><p>When he was charged, Shmudra pled not guilty on all counts at a hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court and was ordered to be held on a two million dollar bail. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In another hearing, his lawyers requested the bail to be lowered, but the judge refused as the prosecution&nbsp;characterized him as the "driving force" in GS9.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Shmurda was looking at 25 years in prison for the most serious of his conspiracy charges.</p><p>He was offered an 8-year plea deal, but he refused.

However, both of them pled not guilty again.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After refusing the plea deal for so long, he finally agreed to it on September 9, 2016.

They offered me five [years]&nbsp;and offered Rowdy 12. They said the only way they’ll give him seven is if I took seven, too. So, you know, I had to take one for the dawgs.</p><p>He was sentenced to seven years, two of which he had already served.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>While his original sentence dictated that he be out by December 11, 2021, he was later given a conditional release in February 2021.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Bobby Shmurda Walks a Free Man</h2><p>Shmurda&nbsp;is not the first rap artist to land behind bars, and many others have jumpstarted their career the moment they were set free—the customary 'First Day Out' freestyle announcing their presence back in the scene.&nbsp;</p><p>Some like <a href=# rel=follow>Draco The Ruler</a> even recorded tracks over the phone while still inside.
