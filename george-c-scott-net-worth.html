The broken glass cut his hand and the flow of blood could not be stanched. This was in the days of Scott's heavy drinking, which was caused by an inner-torment and self-loathing.

However, Kubrick was renowned as a master-level chess player who used to hustle other players in his youth in New York City.</td></tr><tr readability=9.2476489028213><td>23</td><td>In his autobiography, <a href=#>Marlon Brando</a>, Scott's co-star in the film <a href=#>The Formula</a> (1980) -- in a caption for a picture from the film -- recounts that Scott asked him during the shooting of the film whether he, Brando, would ever give the same line-reading twice.

Scott, who was in full costume as General Patton, kept losing to the world champ and was determined to keep playing him all night, if need be, until winning at least one set.</td></tr><tr readability=1.5><td>31</td><td>Best known for playing the legendary General <a href=#>George S.

"Patton", which was released in Cinerama theaters, was the last movie shot in a widescreen format specifically for exhibition on the Cinerama circuit, which featured curved screens. Spectators at the Cinerama showings of "Patton" were awed by the three-dimensional effect of Patton's opening speech, in which Scott as Patton stands by himself on-screen. The scene likely was shot for the purpose of showcasing the Cinerama screen.</td></tr><tr readability=5.9524940617577><td>33</td><td>Played three roles originated by actor <a href=#>Lee J. Cobb</a>.

The play garnered 1974 Tony Award nominations for Nichols for Best Director and Best Actor [Play] nods for Scott and Williamson; Williamson won the 1974 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance).
