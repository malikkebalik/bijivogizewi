While Chicago Fire is nowhere near ending, there are times throughout the year where the One Chicago franchise is on hiatus or not on the air — which is where <a href=#>shows like Chicago Fire</a> come in to tide fans over until the return of Firehouse 51’s beloved firefighters and paramedics.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Chicago Fire</a> is NBC’s drama series following the personal and professional lives of firefighters and paramedics at the Chicago Fire Department’s fictional Firehouse 51 in Chicago, Illinois. The series — which is created by Dick Wolf, the same mind behind the <a href=#>Law & Order</a> and <a href=#>FBI</a> franchises — is the first in the One Chicago franchise, which also includes <a href=#>Chicago P.D.</a> and <a href=#>Chicago Med</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“We were having so much fun making the show that nobody told us we had to worry about ratings and all of these things,” co-creator Derek Haas told <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2016 of Chicago Fire’s journey . “The first episode came out and it did OK. The second episode was way worse and I honestly thought we were dead in the water. We just thought, ‘Oh, OK, that was an interesting six months or year of our lives, but it was fun while it lasted.'”</p><p>Haas continued, “We knew the seventh episode was going to be a good one, it was a Thanksgiving episode and we were just thinking, ‘Man, if we can make it to the seventh, I think we’ll have caught on.’ And then lucky for us, NBC stuck with it, kept promoting it while playing it on Saturdays also. They didn’t get discouraged and let it breathe and then it found its audience. It was about halfway though the fall that we thought, ‘Oh, OK, maybe we’ve got something.’”</p><p>After more than a decade since its premiere, Chicago Fire has become one of NBC’s most popular primetime shows. But if you’ve finished the series and are waiting for new episodes to air, you may be wondering what to do next.

Some of these firefighter shows are a total crock,” Mouch says to Tony in the scene. “That guy had a beard. How you supposed to get a seal on a mask with a beard? Do they not care about the truth?” Tony responds, “Tell ’em to call us. We’ll straighten ’em out.”</p><p>Fire Country follows Bode Donovan (who has a beard), a young convict who volunteers with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection — also known as Cal Fire _ as a way to redeem himself and shorten his prison sentence.
