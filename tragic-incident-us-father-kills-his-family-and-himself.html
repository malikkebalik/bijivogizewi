Michael Haight, 42, fatally shot his wife, her mother, and their five kids on January 4 after being under investigation for child abuse.
Police in the city of Enoch released troubling bodycam footage of the incident, showing the officers approaching the family’s residence where the bodies were found."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Tausha intended to file for divorce from her controlling husband before the tragic events.</p><p>Haight’s attorney, Matt Munson, did not respond to requests for comments.</p><p>Documents revealed that Haight had removed firearms from the home, had been investigated for child abuse, and searched online for “gunshot in a house” before the shootings.</p><p>Child and Family Services had initiated an investigation based on the abuse of the couple’s oldest daughter. The agency had gathered reports of several instances of abuse and had visited the Haight residence weeks before the tragic incident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/US-dad-murders-his-five-kids-wife-and-mother-in-law-then.jpg><p>The caseworkers had never interviewed Michael Haight and, unfortunately, the tragic incident occurred prior to further intervention.</p><p>Previous records showed prior investigations of Haight for child abuse, including concerning incidents such as slamming on the brakes on the highway and physical aggression towards his children.
