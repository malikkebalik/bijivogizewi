Well known knee doctor (Sports Medicine, Knee/ACL Surgery, Texas Sports Medicine), <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=xn-person>Tarek Souryal</span></a> who had been the Dallas Mavericks team doctor and consultant to the NFL, told Reagan that he could get him through the shows. The fracture in the tibia had enough bone to safely compete, but the knee and swelling had to be dealt with to see if it was possible to ride a bike for cardio. With a de-mobilizer fitted to the leg, Lancaster had 3 drainings of the knee and had a strong will to compete. While at the emergency room in Plano Baylor Hospital following the accident, he said there was no way he could make it. Thankfully, "With the help of good doctors and several visits to the hospital I was able to make the shows for the year," reported Lancaster. He was then able to ride a bike for his last 2 weeks, helping him to come in lean enough to compete.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=xn-person>Steve Kuclo</span></a> (IFBB professional and world-class bodybuilder), who gave the award to Reagan said, "I have never seen anything like that before," and called Lancaster a warrior.
