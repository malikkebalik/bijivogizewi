LSK Nairobi branch Thursday warned the public about the individual identified as Brian Mwenda Njagi who has been impersonating an Advocate of the High Court of Kenya.
Brian, LSK said, is not an Advocate of the High Court of Kenya, nor a member of the society.
LSK President Eric Theuri also revealed how the impersonator infiltrated their systems and started practicing law."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The LSK IT team then removed Ntwiga’s email address and updated the account with Mwenda’s, granting him access to the system.</p><p>Mwenda did not, however, pay for a practising certificate since he was required to provide documents including the certificate of business incorporation, which he did not possess.</p><p>“The LSK has commissioned an immediate review of the established protocols on change of membership credentials to enhance the internal control/ approval mechanisms. We have invited the DCI to send their investigators to launch a massive manhunt and the immediate arrest of the masquerader, (Brian Mwenda) and all his accomplices,” Theuri said.</p><p>Theuri warned that impersonators will be kept at bay, as LSK further digitizes its systems.</p><p>“The Council of the Law Society recognizes that masqueraders pose a serious threat to the practice of law and is determined to take decisive action to deal with this issue. We call on members to remain vigilant and inform the Secretariat or their respective Branches of any cases of suspected masqueraders for investigation and apprehension,” he added.</p><p>“We have further in cognizance of the challenges of investigating, tracing and arresting masqueraders, in the budget for the financial year 2024 made provisions for funds to support the weeding out of masqueraders.”</p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254707482874</b><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijkZ2uuK3TrqWgrV6YvK57y6yiZp2opbmitc2sZKGnp2KurbjEoJydZZmivbC%2F056pZpqinq6vec2jmKChXZ67p7XLramarJWZerTF0q2cpqtf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
