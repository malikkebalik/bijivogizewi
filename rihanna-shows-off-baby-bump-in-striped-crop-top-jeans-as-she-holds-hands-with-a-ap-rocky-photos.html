Rocky wore a green quilted vest, red plaid shirt, and graphic tee, and reached up to adjust his own pair of shades while happily walking with the songstress. They were reportedly leaving Maxfields.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rihanna-shows-of-bump-spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>It’s been a busy time for the “Umbrella” and future mom of two. She appeared in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>performance of her Oscar nominated song</a> at the Academy Awards on Sunday, March 12, and famously announced her second pregnancy during her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Super Bowl Halftime </a>performance last month. Rocky was seen raising a champagne glass to his famous girlfriend from the audience.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>But it hasn’t all been smooth for the singer. She caught controversy in February for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>calling her infant son “so fine”</a> in an Instagram comment in February. And in November, she made another controversial move by inviting <strong>Johnny Depp</strong> to appear in her Savage X Fenty fashion show — despite her previous claims of domestic violence by ex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chris Brown</strong></a>. Her history of problematic relationships seemingly escalated with Rocky was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>arrested at LAX airport</a> in 2022 in connection with a 2021 shooting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rihanna-rocky-mega-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Still, as she looks toward motherhood a second time, she confesses that it’s something <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>that “inspires” her.</a> “Becoming a mother has only added to the inspiration in my life,” she told ELLE in February. “I’ve had to find <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the balance</a> between an efficient routine that maximizes precious ‘me’ time and full glam, because I really enjoy that colorful creative process.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“The secret to Rihanna being able to balance it all is the great team she has behind her in all areas and that includes Rocky; He’s her MVP,” an insider told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY in November 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH10e5BuZquhmJa7r62Mm5ibsV2Xwq68jJypqKhdqbyxecmemKerXaWxonnArJipZaKksKzFjKmfqKyfqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
