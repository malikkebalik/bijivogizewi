The four-time Emmy winner, now and forever Guiding Light’s scarlet woman Reva Shayne to soap fans, appears in Bleeding Love with Ewan McGregor and daughter Clara. And they’re not the only parent/child pair in the film: Zimmer’s son Jake Weary is in it, too — and, just to make the whole shebang that much more of a family affair, his wife, Vera Bulder helped craft the story.</p><p>Oh, and she’s in it as well.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MixCollage-14-Feb-2024-07-22-AM-3571.jpg alt="kim zimmer jake weary getty 2" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Bleeding Love is about a father/daughter road trip that the duo undertakes following her overdose — kind of an apology for the addiction problem that she inherited from him. Weary, who was briefly Luke on As the World Turns, plays the daughter’s love interest. You probably recognize him as career criminal Deran from the entire run of TNT’s Animal Kingdom.</p><p>Over a year ago, Zimmer broke the news about the movie <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">on her Instagram</a>. “So excited to share that my daughter-in-law’s first produced film… has been selected into SXSW film festival!” she cheered. “I have a small but juicy role in it… Congrats, team!”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kim-zimmer-book-cover-CBS-Berkley.jpg alt="kim zimmer book cover" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Zimmer is best known, of course, for her soap work. In addition to Guiding Light, she played the memorably named Echo DiSavoy on One Life to Live, Jodie Walker on Santa Barbara, and on The Doctors, she was brought in as a recast for Kathleen Turner as Nola Aldrich… which brings us to her most infamous silver-screen role. In 1981’s Body Heat, she was cast as a lookalike for — who better? — Turner.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-451105719.jpg alt="Promotional shot of actresses Kathleen Turner and Kim Zimmer, as they appear in the movie 'Body Heat', 1981.
