He is best known as the co-founder, guitarist, secondary vocalist, and one of the songwriters for The Rolling Stones.</p><p>The band has sold more than 200 million records worldwide and still tours consistently, earning $117 million off just 14 shows in 2018. Keith and Mick Jagger have written nearly all of the band’s original music.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Musical_Influences>Early Life and Musical Influences</span></h2><p>Keith Richards was born in Dartford, Kent, England on December 18, 1943 to parents Doris Maud Lydia (née Dupree) and Herbert William Richards. His maternal grandfather, Augustus Theodore “Gus” Dupree, was a musician who nurtured Richards’ interest in music and gave him his first guitar.</p><p>Richards and Mick Jagger attended Wentworth Primary School together and were childhood friends. They rekindled their friendship over their mutual love of music and shared a mutual friend, Dick Taylor. Richards also met Taylor while at Sidcup Art College, and Jagger knew Taylor from their amateur band, Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys, which Richards joined soon after.</p><p>The Blue Boys ended after Brian Jones invited Jagger and Richards to the Bricklayers Arms pub, where they met Ian Stewart and bonded over their shared interest in blues music.</p><h2><span id=The_Rolling_Stones_A_Brief_History>The Rolling Stones: A Brief History</span></h2><p>The Rolling Stones were formed in 1962 and originally consisted of Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, Ian Stewart, and Keith Richards. They signed with Decca Records in 1963 and have since released over 100 albums, including 30 studio albums. Jagger and Richards have shared primary songwriting and production duties since Jones’ departure in 1969 and are known as “the Glimmer Twins”. Richards has been called the bandleader by former member Ian Stewart and sets the pace with his guitar, rather than the drummer. The Rolling Stones have performed over 2000 concerts globally.</p><h2><span id=Keith_Richards_Solo_Projects_and_Other_Ventures>Keith Richards’ Solo Projects and Other Ventures</span></h2><p>Keith Richards, aside from being a member of The Rolling Stones, has pursued several solo projects. His first solo single, a cover of Chuck Berry’s “Run Rudolph Run”, was released in 1978. Richards formed the group the “X-Pensive Winos” with co-writer and co-producer Steve Jordan after Mick Jagger pursued a solo career in 1987. The Winos’ first album, “Talk Is Cheap”, has gone gold since its release, and was followed by Richards’ first solo American tours. The Winos’ second album, “Main Offender”, was released in 1992, also followed by a tour. Despite the Winos being a group effort, with Waddy Wachtel (guitarist), Bobby Keys (saxophonist), Ivan Neville (keyboardist) and Charley Drayton (bass) in addition to Steven Jordan, both records are credited to Richards as a solo artist. Richards’ third studio album was released in September 2015, named “Crosseyed Heart”.</p><p>Richards is also a widely recognized producing talent. Aside from his production efforts for The Stones alongside Jagger, Richards has accumulated many production and co-production credits on projects with artists such as Aretha Franklin, Johnnie Johnson, and Ronnie Spector. He even has his own record label, Mindless Records, where he released the track “Wingless Angels” in 1997, a track which he co-produced.</p><p>In addition to music, Richards had a brief foray into the world of acting. After Johnny Depp stated that his characters in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie franchise is loosely based on Richards and the Warner Bros. cartoon character Pepe Le Pew, Richards played the role of Captain Edward Teague in the third installment of the series, “At World’s End” (2007). He later reprised his role in the 2011 fourth installment, “On Stranger Tides”.</p><h2><span id=Drug_Use_and_Legal_Issues>Drug Use and Legal Issues</span></h2><p>Keith Richards has a reputation for drug use and has been tried on drug-related charges five times, dating back to 1967. In 2016, he admitted to occasionally consuming alcohol and cannabis.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>Richards was romantically involved with actress Anita Pallenberg from 1967 to 1979. They had two children together, but tragically lost their third child to sudden infant death syndrome in 1976. Richards married Patti Hansen in 1983, and they have two daughters.</p><h2><span id=Keith_Richards_Properties_and_Assets>Keith Richards’ Properties and Assets</span></h2><p>Keith Richards, the legendary guitarist and member of the Rolling Stones, boasts a guitar collection of approximately 3,000 instruments. He owns several properties, including Redlands, a Sussex estate that he purchased in 1966 for 313,000 pounds. Actress Cate Blanchett has a nearby property in the East Sussex area that she purchased for $4.68 million.</p><p>Richards’ primary residence is located in Weston, Connecticut, and he also owns a property on the private resort island Parrot Cay in the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC3xKKroWWinrCprdGdqmamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
