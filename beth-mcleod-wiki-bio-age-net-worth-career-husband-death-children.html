She was a TV meteorologist for more than a decade, delivering the forecast with accuracy and enthusiasm. But in 2019, her life took a tragic turn when she lost her husband and her mother in a short span of time. She decided to make a radical career change and became a nightclub owner, creating some of the most unique and fun nightlife destinations in Cleveland. In this article, we will explore how Beth McLeod went from weather to nightlife, and how she found a new purpose and joy in her life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Losing her Best Friend</h2><p>Beth McLeod was married to Fred McLeod for over 28 years.

The death of Fred came as a shock to the fans but the one in the most pain was Beth. After all, the couple had been together for 28 years and always made sure that they didn’t stay apart for more than three days.</p><p>“For a good three days my life was just a blur of a good two weeks of time. I don’t remember the funeral. I don’t remember the visitation. I don’t remember a lot. It’s like you’ve been hit by a bus and you can’t get up. It’s really a heavy feeling and I can’t describe it and some days are better than others.”</p><p>Things went from bad to worse for Beth, who lost her mother after five weeks of losing her husband. Not taking anything away from the grief, Beth had already been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mourning</a> her mother for two years.</p><p>“It’s hard to tell the story because I don’t think many people believe that, like, my husband died suddenly and then my mom died but I think my mom had been sick for two years. So, not that that’s easier, but I think I’ve been mourning her for two years as she progressed.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rising Through the Ranks</h2><p>Beth began her professional career at CBS Sports in New York but later moved to WDIV in Detroit, Michigan.
