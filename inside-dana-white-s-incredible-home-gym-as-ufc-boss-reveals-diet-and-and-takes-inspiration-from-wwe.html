You wouldn't expect anything less from a man who is worth a reported $500m and has a gym, bar and money gun at his luxurious office at UFC's headquarters.
And at White's family home, no expense has been spared either.
As part of an interview with Men's Health, the 51-year-old revealed he has a grappling and boxing floor complete with a variety of punching bags around the outside in his gym - the walls are padded if things get out of hand."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I don’t do any heavy weights now. I do all light weight and make sure every movement is perfect and I do it for reps.</p><p>"A lot of people have been saying lately that I look different than I did. I look bigger than I looked. The only thing I’ve changed in the past 10 years of working out is, I hired a trainer.</p><p>"I hired a trainer after getting shoulder surgery and it was a complete game changer for me. When you’ve been working out yourself your whole life and then you get a trainer? I recommend it for everybody."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-16.07.16.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-16.07.37.png><p>Elsewhere in his home gym he has a ‘cold plunge’ pool which is typically used like an athlete would use an ice bath. It helps your muscles relax and flushes out any lactic acid one builds up exercising.</p><p>He also has a steam room adjacent to the cold plunge - good for sweating out the alcohol on occasion - and then he has a full kitchen just around the corner so he can have his meals prepared as he trains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-16.07.45.png><p>But it’s not all about lifting weights and grappling, White has a pilates room too where he has sessions and stretches. In that same room, he has mirrors that actually work as TVs - somehow - and he can do full classes on them.</p><p>For the grind of working out, he also has a full massage and facial room and it’s complete with an LED bed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-16.07.55.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-16.05.46.png><p>Outside, UFC’s head honcho has a lap pool in his garden.</p><p>This comes with jets that create a current in the water than you’re forced to swim against. No pain, no gain and all that.</p><p>White confesses he is not a guy that eats healthy foods. In fact, the entire reason he works out is so he can eat said treats.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-16.08.26.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-16.08.38.png><p>He has a fridge that is solely dedicated to every kind of drink you can imagine from Capri Sun to Voss water to beer and so on.</p><p>Then he has a huge draw dedicated to ice creams for his sweet tooth. He also has a fridge that is for healthy options like fruit, vegetables and yogurt.</p><p>White's typical breakfast is scrambled eggs and sausages or he likes breakfast sandwiches with those kinds of ingredients in. He doesn’t like garlic, onion and seafood among other things and says the Keto diet is the easiest he’s ever been on because he can eat all the things he likes on it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-16.09.25.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-16.09.50.png><p>The diet essentially forces people to burn fats, not carbs. It’s a high-protein, low carb diet.</p><p>White says everyday is cheat day for him - he doesn’t diet.</p><p>"If you look at The Rock, he religiously works out every day and when he’s getting ready for these movie roles. He’s 50 years old.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on talkSPORT">Read More on talkSPORT</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/06/crop-822912.jpg><p>"The dieting this guy does is phenomenal.
