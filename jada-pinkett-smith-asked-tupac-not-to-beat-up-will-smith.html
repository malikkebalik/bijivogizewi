I think that just hurt him more than anything. Because he was like, ‘What do you think this is? I’m not walking around being this impulsive, violent individual. So I think that probably hurt his feelings at the particular time.”</p><p>Despite the criticism, the 49-year-old actress revealed she had to travel down “memory lane” to find the unpublished diamond in the rough.</p><p>“He had a song called ‘Lost Souls’ on the Gang Related soundtrack but I believe this was the original concept because he wrote this, I believe, when he was at Rikers [Island],” she explained, dating the poem to around 1995.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“And I was like, I don’t think he would have minded that I share this with you guys.”</p><p>Check out Napoleon’s full interview below, where he also reveals his reaction to longtime Tupac friend and Digital Underground founder <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Shock G’s death</a>.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZmZ4Z2hI6toK2klWO3orDAZqeippuawbV5z6WcmpyVmXpzvMCcZKenpGLBsHnBnpitZZSkxK951qKjpWWjora1tIysmLKrXaTCtbjAsLFmqpGlvaa%2BjKeYqaecmryv</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
