The world’s most frequent flier just racked up a record-setting 21 million miles flown. That’s nearly 844 times around the equator.
“I’m a flying junkie,” the 65-year-old Nutley, New Jersey, resident told The Post. “If I spend more than a week in one place, I’m like, ‘I gotta get back in the air.’ I’m more afraid to be on the ground than in the air."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Give or take a few million.</p><p>The world’s most frequent flier just racked up a record-setting 21 million miles flown. That’s nearly 844 times around the equator.</p><p>“I’m a flying junkie,” the 65-year-old Nutley, New Jersey, resident told The Post. “If I spend more than a week in one place, I’m like, ‘I gotta get back in the air.’ I’m more afraid to be on the ground than in the air.”</p><p>On July 19, he broke his own rec­ord of 20 million — which was set only in January.</p><p>“That’s the fastest I’ve ever done a million,” said Stuker, who flies ­exclusively with United.</p><p>His jet-setting devotion began in 1984, when he traveled to Melbourne, Australia, to do management consulting for an auto dealer.</p><p>“I fell in love with the country,” said the now-semi-retired Stuker. “I’ve been back over 350 times since.”</p><p>By 1997, Stuker’s business was thriving — and so was his obsession.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/07/stuker-board.jpg><p>“All of a sudden, after I hit 10 million [miles], I started getting into the world records and flying more competitively,” he said.</p><p>The married father of three added it’s “the romance” of flying, not the destinations, that’s his passion. For the most part, he’s traveling just to travel — not for work or vacation — and is known to stay in Australia or Japan for a day.</p><p>“I mean why does Joey Chestnut eat hot dogs?” he asked of the competitive-eating champ. “I just really love everything about flying.”</p><p>That includes the first-class seats, “mega VIP status” and lavish perks that come with being the top miles gatherer, he admitted.</p><p>United regularly treats him to a multitude of luxurious bonuses, like tarmac transfer service in a Mercedes-Benz, complimentary cocktails, the ability to skip lines and membership in its exclusive Polaris Lounge — outfitted with showers, private offices and, often, a slew of celebrities.</p><p>Stuker is full of starry stories: sitting next to Janet Jackson and Steven Tyler in first class, and getting Bill Murray to leave his brother a voicemail. (Stuker’s wife, who often travels with him, was treated to a call from Kenny G.)</p><p>“I usually try to engage them in conversations they may have never had before,” said Stuker of celebs. “I’ll ask, ‘What was your biggest disappointment growing up?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/07/stuker.jpg><p>When he’s not chatting up his cabin-mates, Stuker will blow through all the in-flight entertainment “in about a week” — so he spends his time in the air texting, watching sports and planning more trips. He also pops an Ambien to doze through the flight.</p><p>Once he arrives at a far-flung destination, he’ll take a three-hour power nap to combat jet lag.</p><p>Many compare his lifestyle to the 2009 film “Up in the Air,” starring George Clooney as a travel addict.</p><p>“So much of that movie is bulls–t,” Stuker said. “The biggest fallacy is [that] it’s impossible for him to do the flight schedule he does when he lives in Omaha.”</p><p>Stuker also pays out of pocket for every one of his trips, saving his miles to give to family members, charities and others.</p><p>And his favorite place to go? “Home,” he said. “I don’t get to go there that often.”</p><h2>A typical week for Tom Stuker</h2><p><strong>June 10:</strong> From Las Vegas with his wife home to Newark.<br><strong>June 11:</strong> Newark to Chicago, where he picked up his brother, then on to Narita, Japan.<br><strong>June 12:</strong> Narita to Chicago to Frankfurt, Germany, for three hours.<br><strong>June 13:</strong> Return to Chicago, United’s main hub.<br><strong>June 14:</strong> Chicago to London with his two sons and a daughter-in-law.<br><strong>June 16:</strong> London to Chicago.<br><strong>June 17:</strong> Back to Narita — one of his favorite destinations. “I love Narita,” Stuker said. “They even have a roped-off area for me every time I go there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnp7j3Bma29frLyzuMOsZKano6l6p77EqqyepqRis63FxKtkoZmjYq6vecinqpqmlWLEprHKpbBmoaSeu6a%2BwKuwaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
