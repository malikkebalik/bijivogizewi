His net worth is estimated to be roughly $1 to $5 million which comes from his wrestling performances.</p><h2>Darby Allin salary</h2><p>Wrestlers in the AEW earn an average yearly income of $300,000 per year. While this is somewhat less than what many WWE wrestlers earn, AEW athletes enjoy various perks and bonuses that many WWE wrestlers do not receive. Only top-tier wrestlers, veterans, and main eventers receive fully catered travel and hotel packages in the WWE. On the other hand, regardless of their function or rank in the promotion, all AEW wrestlers enjoy these privileges and incentives. With Darby being a huge draw it can be expected that he would earn more than $500,000 in salary per year.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Before AEW Darby Allin worked in independent circuits</h2><p>Ratsch made his pro wrestling debut in late 2014 for Blue Collar Wrestling in Portland, Oregon as Darby Graves, before changing his ring name to Darby Allin.
