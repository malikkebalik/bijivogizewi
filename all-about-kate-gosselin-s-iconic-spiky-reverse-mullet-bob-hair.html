It became Gosselin’s trademark, and whether fans watched her show or not, she definitely became more famous because of it.&nbsp;</p><h2>Her Iconic Hairdo</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Many fans may not recognize her without her iconic hairdo.&nbsp;It took years of experimentation and changes to get her iconic look right. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In Gosselin's&nbsp;early&nbsp;years, her hair was longer than the trademark asymmetric blonde bob she had on&nbsp;her popular TLC series, and it was all brown as well.</p><p>The reality star, a natural brunette, went for an extreme chop and major color change while rising to fame and living in the public eye. The transformation caught everyone’s attention.</p><p>Her short hair did not start out too spiky, but over the years&nbsp;it got shorter and shorter. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Kate Gosselin and her hairstyle&nbsp;</strong><strong id=docs-internal-guid-ed13d11a-7fff-afc8-22bf-72c2a17b8d50>| Source: Wikimedia&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As the show gained popularity, Gosselin’s hairstyle got shorter and sharper until her iconic crop happened. She added chunky unblended highlights for a dramatic flair, which created a ‘tiger stripe’ effect.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>This blend of tones made her already-famous hair even more distinct, and finally, the Gosselin look was born. This was the hairstyle that people knew her for.</p><p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a>, Gosselin dished on her hairdo.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>&nbsp;It’s my attitude! Everybody wants it. The secret to getting the style, right? I have very, very thick hair, so it will not work for everybody. I’ve seen people come through the book line with thin hair, and [it] just won’t work.&nbsp;</p><h2>Inspiring Celebrities and Memes</h2><p>In 2015, <a href=# rel=follow>Justin Bieber</a> appeared on the VMAs red carpet with a purposefully disheveled long, side-swept fringe scarecrow hair. Bieber quickly became the subject of the internet’s scrutiny when fans noticed the resemblance with Gosselin’s hairdo circa&nbsp;the mid-2000s.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Bieber himself even Instagrammed a meme illustrating the likeness, which he has since deleted. But Gosselin got to sit down with Cosmopolitan to weigh in on the hairdo and secured cool mom points.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Her mane&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reached</a>&nbsp;new heights of a cultural phenomenon but for all the wrong reasons when the Gosselin hairdo became the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">associated</a> look for “Karens” everywhere.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Karens are middle-aged white women with an asymmetrical bob and known for the aggressive personalities and famous catchphrase, “Can I speak to your manager?.”</p><p>Everyone considers them to be entitled and ignorant. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Whether Gosselin is a “Karen,” or not, one thing’s for sure; her look continues to evolve to this day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKhdmMKtwNSrnGijkamybrPOrKqepJmjerS0zqurZqCRnr9vtNOmow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
