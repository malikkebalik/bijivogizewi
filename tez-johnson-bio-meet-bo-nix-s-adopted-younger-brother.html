But what’s the backstory? How did the two come so close, and are they brothers legally? Let’s dive into who Bo Nix’s brother, Tez Johnson is.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Dossier><strong>Dossier</strong></span></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody readability=1><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Keyonteze Johnson</td></tr><tr><td>Nick Name</td><td>Tez</td></tr><tr><td>DOB</td><td>May 18, 2002</td></tr><tr><td>Hometown</td><td>Pinso, Alabama</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5’10”</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>150 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>African-American</td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac Sign</td><td>Leo</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Sibling</td><td>Bo Nix (Adoptive Brother)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>College Football Athlete</td></tr><tr><td>Position</td><td>Wide Receiver</td></tr><tr><td>Current Team</td><td>Oregon Ducks</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Tez_Johnsons_Early_Life_and_Childhood><strong>Tez Johnson’s Early Life and Childhood</strong></span></h2><p>Tez grew up in Pinson, Alabama. As a kid, he saw everything a kid shouldn’t have, from abject poverty to shootings and prevalent drug use. He told in an interview with Pac-12-</p><p>“It was a struggle coming up, we didn’t have beds at one point, and didn’t know where the next meal was coming from. Growing up in a crazy environment, you just see violence every day. You see shootings every day. It was just so depressing as a little kid. I never went home and I was always in trouble.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">Oregon’s Bo Nix, and Tez Johnson share a brotherly bond on and off the football field via Pac-12 Networks</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=How_Tez_and_Bo_Nix_First_Met><strong>How Tez and Bo Nix First Met</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sportzhive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tez-Johnson-and-Bo-Nix.jpg><p>Tez and Bo met when the Nix family first moved to Pinsonn, Alabama. Patrick Nix, the father of Bo Nix, was the high school coach at Pinson Valley High, where he coached Tez as well.</p><p>His unique ability and athleticism made him stand out from the rest, and when the coach decided to make the players familiar with each other, they held a meeting. Bo’s impression of Tez at first was that he was the skinniest kid on the field, and the one with great ball skills.</p><p>He said in a recent documentary- “I didn’t really know Tez until the day I went out there and threw for the first time. The first person that comes running out on the field is this little bitty scrawny kid, probably one of the skinniest kids I’ve ever seen in my entire life.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=How_Patrick_and_Krista_Nix_Came_to_Adopt_Tez><strong>How Patrick and Krista Nix Came to Adopt Tez</strong></span></h2><p>Tez wasn’t dealt the best of hands to begin with, but he was a survivor. To him, football was more of an escape. He was trying his best to make the most out of his situation, and that’s when Patrick took a liking to the young wide receiver.</p><p>Being the only strong male figure in his life, coach Patrick decided to invite Tez to stay with the Nix family for a couple of weeks when he was only 15. The weeks turned to months, and months turned into the rest of his life.</p><p>Tez recalled- “I pulled up to the house, walked in, and they were sitting at the dinner table, and I knew right then and there that I didn’t wanna leave.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Is_He_Legally_Adopted><strong>Is He Legally Adopted?</strong></span></h2><p>Though Patrick and Krista never adopted Tez officially, he is one of the main members of the household. We can find frequent posts from his adoptive mother, Krista, on her social media. He is always in the family photos, reunions, and gatherings. He may not be an official member of the Nix family in papers, but by heart, they are all one, and one for all.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading></h2><p>Tez started out as a quarterback in high school and transitioned to a wide receiver later as a senior. He attended Pinson Valley High School in Pinson, where he was a standout receiver, however, he was labeled a mere three-star recruit by 247Sports, ESPN, and Rivals. In 2021, he signed with Troy University. Johnson had a breakout freshman season at Troy, catching 67 passes for 720 yards and seven touchdowns. He was named to the All-Sun Belt Third Team.</p><p>In 2022, Johnson decided to rejoin his brother at Oregon and was expected to be a key contributor in the offense. He has already made some significant contributions to the team’s success with his amazing catching abilities and touchdowns.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Tezs_NIL_deal><strong>Tez’s NIL deal</strong></span></h2><p>Tez Johnson signed a few NIL deals after transferring to Oregon. In May 2023, he signed a deal with the Oregon Ducks football team’s official NIL collective, Oregon Edge. The deal is reported to be around $100,000.</p><p>Johnson has a profile on Opendorse, a platform that allows athletes to connect with brands and fans for more NIL deals.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Conclusion><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2><p>The new Pac-12 network documentary provided us an opportunity to get a glimpse into the life of Tez and Bo Nix and share their inseparable bond. As the Ducks make progress towards their aspirations of a Pac-12 championship, and Bo trying to bag that Heisman Trophy, the Ducks are on an upward spiral.</p><p>With jersey numbers 15 and 10 on your team, you really shouldn’t worry about wins and losses, but enjoy the movie starring brothers from different mothers.</p><p><strong>Recommended For You:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Meet Cameron Rising’s parents, Eunice and Nicko Rising: A look inside Utah Utes QB’s family</a></p><p><a href=#>Joe Milton Bio: Age, Height, Weight, Hometown, Career, College, Family and more</a></p><p><a href=#>Dillon Gabriel Bio: Age, Height, Weight, Hometown, Career, College, Family and more</a><span contenteditable=false></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FtcbHoq2eZpOkunCvzqWjnp%2BVYrOwu9ObmKWkX6myu3nJqJ%2Bnq5%2BjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
