The NBA champion shed some light on his condition on Mar. 20, saying he had a hip replacement.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“To all the people who are concerned,” Shaq began the caption of his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram message</a>. “First, let me start off by saying, ‘thank you.’ And lastly, I am fine. Just had to get some BBL [Brazilian butt lift] work done, aka #hipreplacement.” Shaq’s animated gif showed his backside bouncing better than a basketball to further drive home the joke. “But, yes,” he added, “I am fine. No need to worry.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>i’m always watching <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@TurnerSportsEJ</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@Candace_Parker</a> miss y’all <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/4tY4X6v1Pj</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>— SHAQ (@SHAQ) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>March 19, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Welp. Can’t unsee that,” one fan joked on Shaq’s bootylicious IG post. “Cheekquille O’Neal,” said another. “We need a dislike button,” joked sports broadcaster <strong>Kristen Ledlow. </strong>“Good to know, bro the Hips Don’t Lie right, [<strong>Shakira</strong>]?” joked Shaq’s former teammate <strong>Rick Fox.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>There was a hint that Shaq was getting a bionic hip from <strong>Jeannine Edwards. </strong>The former ESPN/ABC sportscaster commented on Shaq’s original message. “Feel better, my friend! I just had my hip replaced one month ago. Back in the gym for two weeks…. full steam ahead!” she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/shaq-hip-replacement-surgery-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Shaq recently had some fans <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>grabbing their stomachs</a> after he made good on the bet. Shaq made a wager with his Ernie Johnson over the University of Georgia – Texas Christian University football game. If the Bulldogs beat the TCU Horned Frogs, Shaq said he would eat a frog. Since Georgia came through – 65-7 – EJ served up his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NBA On TNT</a> cohost a plate of frog legs.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Technically, they were Cuisses de Grenouille, a traditional French dish of fried frog legs. “I’m a man of my word,” said Shaq before digging in. “I just want to let you all know these frog legs are good. These are the best frog legs I done had ever,” he said with a piece of frog in his teeth. “You didn’t think I was going to do it, did you?” Hopefully, he didn’t get too addicted. He wouldn’t want to add on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>that 40 lbs. he just lost.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH10e5FqZqygkabCqrjLnmSoppWWuW60yKlkq52goa6kscyepa1lmKTAsbXTmqNmqJikwbB7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
