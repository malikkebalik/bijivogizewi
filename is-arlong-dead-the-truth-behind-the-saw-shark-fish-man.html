Luffy? Is he dead or alive? And what is his role in the current story of One Piece? Here is a guide for fans who want to know more about Arlong’s fate and character.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Arlong’s Past and Crimes</h2><p>Arlong was born in the Fish-Man District of Fish-Man Island, where he grew up with a hatred for humans due to the oppression and discrimination they faced from them. He joined the Sun Pirates, a crew of fish-men and mermen led by Fisher Tiger, who fought against the World Government and freed many slaves. Arlong was one of the most violent and ruthless members of the crew, and often clashed with Jinbe, the first mate, who advocated for peaceful coexistence with humans</p><p>After Fisher Tiger’s death, Arlong was captured and sent to Impel Down, the underwater prison of the World Government. However, he was released thanks to Jinbe becoming one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, a group of pirates who work for the government. Arlong then split from Jinbe’s crew and formed his own crew, the Arlong Pirates, with the goal of conquering the East Blue, the weakest of the four seas. He believed that fish-men were superior to humans and treated them as inferior beings. He also had a tattoo of the Sun Pirates’ symbol on his chest, which he later modified to hide the sun and emphasize the crossbones</p><p>Arlong and his crew settled on the Conomi Islands, where they terrorized the local population and extorted money from them. He also killed Bell-mère, the foster mother of Nami and Nojiko, and forced Nami to join his crew as a cartographer, taking advantage of her skills to map the entire world. He also made a deal with her, promising to free her and her village if she paid him 100 million berries. However, he had no intention of keeping his promise and planned to kill her once she completed her task. He also built Arlong Park, a fortress that served as his base and symbol of his power</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Arlong’s Defeat and Arrest</h2><p>Arlong’s reign of terror came to an end when he encountered the Straw Hat Pirates, a crew of young pirates led by Monkey D. Luffy, who came to the island in search of Nami. Luffy, who considered Nami as his friend and navigator, decided to fight Arlong and free her from his clutches. He was joined by his crewmates Zoro, Usopp, and Sanji, as well as Johnny, Yosaku, and the villagers of Cocoyasi Village, who rebelled against Arlong’s tyranny</p><p>Arlong proved to be a formidable opponent, as he was physically stronger and faster than most humans, and could use his saw-shaped nose and teeth as weapons. He also had a weapon called Kiribachi, a six-bladed sword that resembled a saw. He also had a deep knowledge of fish-men anatomy, and could exploit the weaknesses of his opponents. He also had a loyal and powerful crew, composed of Hatchan, a six-armed octopus fish-man, Kuroobi, a ray fish-man, Chew, a sea cow fish-man, and several other fish-men and mermen</p><p>However, Arlong and his crew were ultimately defeated by the Straw Hats and their allies, who displayed remarkable courage and determination. Luffy, who was enraged by Arlong’s cruelty and betrayal of Nami, fought him in a fierce battle that destroyed most of Arlong Park. Luffy managed to overcome Arlong’s strength and speed with his rubber powers and his willpower, and delivered the final blow with his signature attack, Gum-Gum Bazooka, smashing Arlong’s head through the stone tower of his base</p><p>With Arlong’s defeat, Nami was freed from his control and officially joined the Straw Hat Pirates as their navigator. The villagers celebrated their liberation and thanked the Straw Hats for their help. Arlong and his crew were then arrested by Commodore Pudding Pudding, a marine officer who arrived at the scene after being informed by Nezumi, a corrupt marine captain who had been working with Arlong. Arlong was last seen being dragged away by the marines, cursing Luffy and Nami</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Arlong’s Current Status and Role</h2><p>Arlong’s current status and role in the story of One Piece are unknown. He has not been seen or mentioned since his arrest, and it is unclear what happened to him and his crew after that. There are several possibilities for his fate:</p><ul><li>He could have been executed by the World Government, as he was a notorious pirate and a fish-man, both of which are considered as enemies by the government. This would mean that he is dead and has no further role in the story.</li><li>He could have been imprisoned in Impel Down again, or in another marine facility, where he would be subjected to harsh conditions and torture. This would mean that he is alive but has no chance of escaping or influencing the story.</li><li>He could have escaped from prison, either by himself or with the help of someone else, such as the New Fish-Man Pirates, a group of fish-men extremists who idolize Arlong and his ideals. This would mean that he is alive and could potentially return to the story as an ally or an enemy of the Straw Hats or other characters.</li></ul><p>The most likely scenario is the second one, as Arlong is a dangerous criminal who would not be easily killed or freed by the World Government. However, there is no definitive answer to his fate, and it is possible that Oda, the author of One Piece, has a different plan for him. Arlong could still have a role in the story, either as a flashback character, a plot device, or a surprise comeback. He could also have a connection to other characters or events that have not been revealed yet.</p><p>For example, Arlong is the older half-brother of Madam Shyarly, a fortune teller and the owner of the Mermaid Cafe on Fish-Man Island. She is also the former lover of Jinbe, and the mother of Caribou, a pirate and a former member of the Fake Straw Hat Crew. Shyarly has the ability to see the future, and she predicted that Luffy would destroy Fish-Man Island. She also has a tattoo of the Sun Pirates’ symbol on her chest, which she inherited from Fisher Tiger</p><p>Arlong could also have a connection to Hody Jones, the leader of the New Fish-Man Pirates and the main antagonist of the Fishman Island Arc. Hody was a former soldier of the Neptune Army, who became obsessed with Arlong’s ideology and actions. He formed his own crew, composed of young fish-men who shared his hatred for humans, and plotted to overthrow the royal family of Fish-Man Island and wage war against the surface world. He also used a drug called Energy Steroids, which enhanced his strength and speed, but also aged him rapidly and made him more violent and insane. He was defeated by Luffy and his crew, and was imprisoned in the Sea Forest, where he became an old and frail fish-man</p><p>Arlong could also have a connection to the Reverie, a meeting of the kings and queens of the world that takes place every four years at Mary Geoise, the holy land of the World Government. One of the topics of the Reverie is the status and rights of fish-men and mermen, who have been oppressed and discriminated by humans for centuries. Some of the participants of the Reverie are Princess Shirahoshi, the daughter of King Neptune and the ancient weapon Poseidon, who can communicate with Sea Kings, and Princess Vivi, the daughter of King Cobra and a former member of the Straw Hat Pirates. <a href=# rel=noopener>Both of them have met and befriended Luffy and his crew, and have witnessed their actions and ideals</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">5</a></p><p>Arlong could also have a connection to the final war, a massive conflict that will involve the Straw Hat Pirates, the World Government, the Four Emperors, the Seven Warlords of the Sea, the Revolutionary Army, and other factions and characters. This war will be triggered by the discovery of the One Piece, the legendary treasure left by the Pirate King Gol D. Roger, which is hidden in the final island of the Grand Line, Laugh Tale. The One Piece is said to contain the true history of the world, which has been hidden by the World Government for 800 years. This history involves the Void Century, a period of time when an ancient kingdom was destroyed by the ancestors of the World Nobles, who established the World Government. The ancient kingdom had a close relationship with the fish-men and mermen, and had built the Poneglyphs, stone tablets that contain information about the history and the locations of the ancient weapons, Pluton, Poseidon, and Uranus.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>Arlong is a character that has left a lasting impact on the story and the characters of One Piece. He is the man who killed Nami’s foster mother, enslaved her and her village, and made her hate pirates.
