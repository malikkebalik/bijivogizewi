The best Raid Build for Iron Hands requires it to have the Belly Drum move, which maximizes the attack stat by cutting the user’s HP in half, and the Drain Punch move, which restores health equal to half the damage inflicted. The remaining two moves can be customized based on preference and the opponent’s weaknesses. To optimize Iron Hands’ effectiveness, players can purchase the Punching Glove held item from Zapapico, and use the Montenevera Hyper Training to boost all of its stats except Sp. Atk and Speed, and use Vitamins and feathers to boost attack and all defensive EV stats. Additionally, players can use the Adamant Mint to ensure that Iron Hands has the Adamant nature, which raises attack and lowers Sp. Atk. Once set up with the Raid Build, players can use Belly Drum to maximize the attack stat and then use Drain Punch to deal damage and restore lost health. During the raid battle, players should keep using Drain Punch or another attack until the Raid Pokemon negates all stat changes for the team. If at full health with the Belly Drum attack bonus active, players can use Close Combat for even more damage. Iron Hands is obtainable in Pokemon Violet after completing all three plot lines and accessing Area Zero in the Great Crater of Paldea. Unfortunately, there is no Belly Drum TM available in-game, making Iron Hands one of the few Pokemon that can learn the move organically through leveling.</p><h2 id=where_to_find_iron_hands_in_pokemon_scarlet class=smooth-goto>Where to find Iron Hands in Pokemon Scarlet?</h2><p>Iron Hands is a Paradox Pokemon that can only be found in Pokemon Violet in The Great Crater of Paldea’s cliff zones around Research Stations 1, 2, and 3. However, the location is only accessible once you clear all three story paths. It’s important to note that Iron Hands is not available in Pokemon Scarlet, so players of this version will need to trade with friends who play Pokemon Violet to obtain it.

Iron Hands is a unique Pokemon that resembles Hariyama but does not evolve from it.
