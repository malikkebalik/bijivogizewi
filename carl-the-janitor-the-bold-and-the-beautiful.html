I don’t think he’ll stalk her, but he doesn’t know how to properly pursue a woman. Bridget seems to be too smart for him. I don’t think anything else will develop."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

All he needs is a make-over Forrester style. After all Brooke and Ridge created a men’s line that is still making money for Forrester,so with that and a few other things… Bridget might look twice at him. It is also refreshing that even though Bridget is a Forrester and a doctor she is not snooty and is friends with Carl even though he is not in her socieconomic background. :]</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Touched</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>October 14, 2007, 12:39am <span itemprop=position>5</span></span><p>What I want to know is Carl going to be in the delivery room since he’s every where else? 8)</p><p>Quote <strong>1Sandy</strong>: Does anyone know or think if this Carl (the Janitor) has any other agenda in mind?

And so the eggs remain scrambled, poor Kid, when he’s twenty he will find out that Brigette is his mom, who knew the truth at 10 years but kept quiet to protect her mothers destiny… <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/frowning.png title=:frowning: alt=:frowning: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Quote <strong>BaileyBaby</strong>: I think at the very least Carl is Mr Wierdly...Although today he graduated to Mr Touchy Feely.

Since when do janitors get to be involved and see the outcome of a dna test??? and when does a dna test get to be done without telling the mother(taylor?) and another thing! (lol) when bridgette was going in the delivery room and on the phone with her mother saying 'theres something wrong with the heartbeat!" isnt that privileged and private information??? too unrealistic. shes acting like someone who never went to medical school or read the HEPA laws. grrrrr irritates me!!</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>sally2</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>October 16, 2007, 10:58pm <span itemprop=position>11</span></span><p>I love the CARL character , creepy , NO …Geeky , YES !<br>we all grew up knowing “A CARL” somewhere in our past .<br>His character has the potential for some serious fun , while moving through the rich and famous crowd .

Bridget needs a new guy. Maybe he will show up at her door one day and be a totally new man. (After the Forrester make-over suggested earlier.)</p><p>I just don’t get Carl. Or Bridget with him. Why would a doctor turn her back as the janitor read test results to her? Wouldn’t she want to see them? Why does she trust him so much?</p><p>:)) I get a kick out of Carl too. He adds a little comedy to the show. I can’t see Carl & Bridget being together either - but he is funny pursuing her!</p><p>The Kiss was going over the top especially another hospital employee walking in, he grabs her and acted like the other doctor entering the room needed to rent his own room. Sooo unrealistic. Bridgett should have slapped him into next week. He would have been so fired the first time he broke patient privacy and confidentiality. Now he is busted kissing a doctor? He is creepy, but smarter than he appears, I think he did the switcharoo thing just to get closer to Bridgett.</p><p>Wow a lot of lives to mess with just for a date or a glance in his direction. This s/l with Carl might end up surprising us all, I sure hope so because it seems to be going no where right now. That is an interesting point about the DNA matching Brooke if it is Bridgetts child but the percentage would show less making it inpossible but hey’ the janitor and the doctor story is a little out there too.</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>berte</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>October 17, 2007, 1:11pm <span itemprop=position>16</span></span><p>I think Carl whose ability extends beyond being a janitor. Maybe he could not afford college. He obviously hands around the lab for more than cleanup. Fiction sometimes imitates life. Dr. (honorary) Vivien Thompson stated his research when he was employed as a janitor at Vanderbilt University. He later was classified as a lab tech and paid as a Janitor at the John Hopkins University yet his lab research led to the creation of the surgical procedure that cured the "blue baby syndrome’. Dr. Alfred Blaylock performed the first successful surgery with Vivien standing over his should talking him through the surgery. Maybe Carl is one of those who wanted to become a doctor but circumstances prevented him. Just a thought. Maybe Carl is pursing a dream as well as Bridget. I hope they don’t make him a bad guy.

Between him and Bridget, I don’t know which has violated patient rights more!!!</p><p>HIPAA is put in place for a reason and Bridget, as a doctor, should know that better than anyone. Docs are forbid to discuss patient cases in public areas of a hospital let alone answer a phone call and start spewing patient information to just anyone, regardless of who it is (in the case yesterday, it was Brooke!!!).</p><p>As someone said in another thread yesterday, these two morons are an embarrassment to all medical personnel, if the writers are going to write SL’s, at least make them credible rather than lame attempts at presenting unrealistic material they obviously know nothing about!!!</p><p>I wouldn’t want to be in the same hospital with either one of these clowns unless I wanted my business to be topic of discussion all over creation!!!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvCmqmlZaSdsm62wKegraeiZH9xhZJtaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
