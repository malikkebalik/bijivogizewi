His height often dictated the nature of his roles. In 1977, he played Mormon Church founder <strong>Joseph Smith, </strong>a historical figure known to have physical stature, in Brigham. &nbsp;In the comedy flick <i>Caveman, </i>he played the abominable snowman, and a cyclops in an episode of <i>Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.&nbsp;</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/richard-moll-dead-ss-EMBED.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Over the years, his shaved head also turned out to be part of his identity. After he rocked a bald head specifically for his role in 1983 sci-fi movie&nbsp; Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn,&nbsp;he wound up keeping it that way. In a 2010 interview, he divulged that producers had asked him to again shave it after an audition for Night Court.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“They said ‘Richard, the shaved head looks good. Will you shave your head<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> for the part</a>?” he recounted at the time. “I said, ‘Are you kidding? I’ll shave my legs for the part. I’ll shave my armpits, I don’t care.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>He wound up an unforgettable part of the sitcom, and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> starred alongside 80s</a> icons <strong>John Larroquette</strong>, <strong>Markie Post</strong>, and <strong>Harry Anderson</strong> for 192 of 193 episodes. He also appeared in episodes of T.J. Hooker,&nbsp;Alice, B.J. and the Bear,&nbsp;and The Dukes of Hazzard,&nbsp;among others.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>He was married twice — to <strong>Laura Class</strong> and <strong>Susan Brown</strong> — and leaves behind two children and two stepchildren.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5xe5FwZquhk52us7CMpqalpF2ks266yKCfrWWTpMKzwIydnJqcXZbBboSPaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
