Residents of the village participated in the event. A shocking death occurred last month to Phil Lewis, who was the spouse of Debbie and the father of four sons. Phil was the head coach and manager for a number of local football teams and players.</p><p>Phil was a devoted fan of the Forest and loved teaching and managing local teams. Under his management, the Codnor boys won Division One. The sudden passing of Phil left his family and former students in utter disarray. A young man named Craig Smith, whom he had previously coached had the idea to hold a charity football tournament in order to raise money for the British Heart Foundation and a memorial bench to be placed at Selston Country Park. It was possible for a lot of Phil’s athletes to take part.</p><p>The Dale Club was happy to lend a helping hand when they were asked whether the charity match might be played on one of their fields. The numerous people who came were lit by the bright sunshine as they gathered to listen to stories told by friends and family. It is fitting that we memorialize Phil in these towns by making this event an annual tradition.</p><p>We would like to express our condolences to Phil’s family and friends, and we are grateful to you for taking the time to speak with The Nugget and help make this article possible. The event brought in slightly more than 1000 pounds. Ambassador Mr. Richard Jacksdale, Representing Westwood and Ironville</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZL2ptctmo56vmah6sK7IrayaqqlisaK4xGaapa2SYrqwwdGnqmasmJp6pbHArZ9mp5Zir6a4zq%2BcnWWcpLCiuIylnKCdnpl6sbTIpWSlnaeewHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
