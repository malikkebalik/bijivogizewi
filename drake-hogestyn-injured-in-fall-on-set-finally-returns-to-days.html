Updated July 25: Original report aside, in a statement made to Soap Opera Digest, Hogestyn’s legal team mades claims that the actor was injured while filming “Days” on set, during a stunt where he was required to break through a prop door on a set which had not been properly prepared."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Hogestyn ran full speed toward the door and smashed headfirst into it suffering severe head injuries. He was hospitalized in May and is now convalescing at home in Malibu. The lawyer says,&nbsp;“Drake, his wife Victoria, and the Hogestyn family, appreciate all the good wishes, prayers and positive thoughts from so many loyal fans, but ask that their privacy be respected at this time. Drake’s goal is to get back to the show as soon as possible.” Originally, it was reported that the actor fell on his own property.</p><p><strong>Originally posted June 29:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Drake Hogestyn</a> has been portraying John Black&nbsp;off and on since 1986, though the character was created in 1985. He was seen recently, scouting a new PI for Black Patch Investigations in his son Paul (Christopher Sean), but in real life, according to The Globe, the actor has taken some time off to mend after a nasty fall from a tree on his property.&nbsp;The character&nbsp;has allegedly been written out temporarily while Hogestyn recovers. According to reports, the actor suffered internal bleeding after the fall in May. Though he has been&nbsp;on canvas for several weeks, due to the show’s advanced taping schedule, Soaps.com has no word yet on&nbsp;when he will be written out or for how long.</p><p>Follow <a href=# rel="me nofollow">Soaps.com on Twitter</a>, <a href=# rel="me nofollow">Days of our Lives on Twitter</a>, and <a href=# rel="me nofollow">Soaps.com on Facebook</a>.</p><p>Photo credit: Howard Wise/JPI</p><p>– Christine Fix</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BOp5ywq19phXN9mGibmrGjYrynec6uqWakmauytHnDq5iknV2dvKix0q2wp2WZo7e2vsSdZKKmXZuurbiO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
