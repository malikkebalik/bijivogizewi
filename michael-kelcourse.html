Every year on October 13th, he celebrates his birthday. Furthermore, Michael was born under the sign of Libra. Character traits such as kindness, gentleness, and friendliness are bestowed by the sign and perfectly define him.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Kelcourse8217s_family_hometown_and_education>Michael Kelcourse’s family, hometown, and education</span></h2><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Michael Kelcourse was born in his hometown of Michigan, the United States, to anonymous parents. While his parents’ identities are unknown, he is the son of Paul Allan Kelcourse and Sandra Marvie Kelcourse, according to a few internet sites.</p><p>If that is correct, Michael Kelcourse’s father died on March 28, 2014. His obituary was published on Legacy.com, and his wife stated,</p><p>“I recall vividly the day I met you and the day I lost you, as well as many of the special occasions in between! You are still present in my thoughts and feelings. Sandy, with love.”</p><p>Michael’s aunt, Loanna Harris, is also a member of his family. When it comes to Michael’s education, he went to Lahser High School. Michael later attended Washtenaw Community College.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW181909246 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW181909246 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW181909246 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":40,"335559739":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Michael Kelcourse does not appear to be particularly interested in social media. His only public profile could be found on Facebook, and even that platform reveals very little about him.</p><p>Aside from that, many people are unaware of Michael’s presence on other platforms such as Instagram and Twitter. And there’s still the possibility that he’s not on the platform at all.</p><h2><span id=Height_weight_and_stroke_rate>Height, weight, and stroke rate</span></h2><p>Michael, a bald man with gray hair, puts on eyeglasses for better vision. From the outside, he appears to be a very gentle and caring individual.</p><p>In terms of height, <strong>Michael Kelcourse is 5 feet 8 inches tall (1.72 meters). He weighed approximately 82 kilograms (180 lbs) due to his well-built physique and muscles.</strong></p><p>Whitney Sudler-Smith revealed in late February 2021 that Michael Kelcourse had suffered an acute spinal cord stroke. The stroke resulted in severe nerve damage and impairment.</p><h2><span id=Net_Michael_Kelcourse_Worth_House_and_Southern_Charm>Net Michael Kelcourse Worth, House, and Southern Charm</span></h2><p>Michael was a voracious reader as a child in Michigan. He began working in a nursing home shortly after graduating from a community college. His loving and caring nature eventually assisted him in establishing a career in human care.</p><p>Speaking more about his early days with The Glampad, he revealed that he participated in career service during high school. The Nederlander Theater required a mother’s helper/footman, a father’s he was told.</p><p>Michael was invited to the subsequent events because he enjoyed what he did. He had no idea, however, that it could lead to a successful career. At the age of 23, his father arranged for him to work in a gourmet restaurant in Ireland. He also received additional training in England. The experience drew him even deeper into a career in service, which also paid well.</p><p>Before meeting Patricia Altschul, Michael worked for Mrs. Lillian Bostwick for 13 years until she died. She regarded him as one of her most valued employees. As he mentioned in his interview with DECIDER, her family assisted American billionaire John D. Rockefeller in developing standard oil.</p><p>But, as fate would have it, Michael Kelcourse ended up meeting the Southern Charm star. Patricia, as previously reported, was looking for a butler for her waterfront estate in Oyster Bay, New York. Patricia asked Michael to work for her right away, even though his contract with the Bostwicks had not yet expired.</p><p>As of this writing, Michael Kelcourse has been working with Southern Charm star Patricia Altschul for 17 years. People wanted to know where he lived after he was introduced as an unofficial cast member of Southern Charm.</p><p>Patricia’s Charleston butler is regarded as an honorary cast member by fans of the show. He is in charge of the staff. Michael, it turns out, lived in a late-1700s cottage on the property. The house has been well-furnished after remodeling, with a bedroom and bathroom, a living room, a dining area with a fireplace, and, of course, a chef’s kitchen.</p><p>He also worked as a hairstylist during the COVID-19 pandemic. He is also well-known for serving his signature martini and having a dry sense of humor, which makes him a fan favorite.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Michael_Kelcourse><span class="TextRun SCXW71746626 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW71746626 BCX8">What is the Net worth of Michael Kelcourse?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW71746626 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>She was also compared to Henry from Dead Ringer for his dedication to the service. Michael amassed a net worth of slightly more than <strong>$500 thousand</strong> through his service to the socialites for over 35 years.</p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Michael Kelcourse estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

He is single, as indicated by his Facebook profile, but the question remains, has he previously married? Do you know if he has a wife?</p><p>That, too, remains a mystery as of this writing. Nonetheless, Michael is always available to Patricia Altschul when she needs relationship advice. During Andy Cohen’s interview on Watch What Happens Live, fellow guest Kristin Chenoweth had to guess what unspeakable tasks Michael performed for Patricia. Patricia stated on the show that he never had to dump her suitor because she is perfectly capable of doing so. She also stated that she and Michael never shared a cocktail because he is not a drinker.</p><p>Michael is very close to Cameran and Whitney, in addition to his adorable relationship with Patricia. While he regards Cameran as his daughter and is always willing to assist her. Similarly, Michael has a similar relationship with Whitney and regards him as her stepson.</p><p>On weekends off from work, Michael can be found in his cottage with four dogs and five feral cats.</p><p>But, as you know, fans are notorious for spreading rumors. Some even thought of them as a secretly dating couple. Patricia and Michael, on the other hand, both confirmed that they are not involved in any way.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Read More: </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Gloom</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>,</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400> Skyler Joy</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Mikayla Demaiter</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Abby Labar</span></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Jeannette Ogden</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Dr. Wellington García</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVforaktMCeo2ajlaGwsMHRrJxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
