The following year, he was the 12th first-round draft pick for the New York Knicks and played for the team between 1991 and 1995.</p><p class=Eg>Greg <a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://andscape.com/features/ex-nba-player-greg-anthonys-heralded-son-cole-to-make-college-choice/>solidified his reputation</a> in the New York Knicks, led by Pat Riley, as a strong point guard and defender during those years, averaging 7.3 points and four rebounds across 757 games in several cities. He now works as an <a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/greganthony50/?hl=en">NBA analyst</a> for Turner Sports and has an active social media presence.</p><p class=Eg>Greg opened up about the birth of his son on May 20, 2000, during a 2019 interview. At the time, he played for the Portland Trail Blazers and requested a leave of absence to be present for Cole's arrival. And so, after a Friday night game, the former NBA guard flew home the next morning to be with his family.</p><p class=Eg>Cole's birth, however, wasn't without a few scares as the doctors deliberated a possible C-section due to a condition that complicated his delivery and threatened his life. Thankfully, the process worked out, and he arrived naturally.

Cole valued his dad's knowledge of the game and was always open to Greg's constructive criticism.</p><p class=Eg>Around the seventh grade, Cole decided to take basketball seriously, and he started paying more attention to his father's guidance. Greg ensured to instill the attitude of a leader, ensuring that Cole would find value and joy in the victories of his teammates and his own.</p><p class=Eg>At only 13 years old, Cole won a one-on-one against his dad, a game the Turner Sports analyst claimed he didn't remember.
