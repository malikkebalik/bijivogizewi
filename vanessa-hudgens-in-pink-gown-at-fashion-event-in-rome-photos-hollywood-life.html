The High School Musical alum took to her Instagram to share snaps of herself and her sister <strong>Stella</strong> before the star-studded event<strong>, </strong>as they posed like supermodels in their own gowns from the epic collaboration. “A beautiful evening celebrating the&nbsp;#GiambattistaVallixMytheresa Collection last night with&nbsp;@mytheresa.com and the icon himself @giambattistavalli,” she captioned the photo album.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Looking flawless per usual, Vanessa was every inch the fashionista in her stunning pink dress featuring a ruffled bodice and long train. Her trademark raven tresses were styled long and luxurious, with a bounce and curl to add some pizazz. Stella was simply a vision in her green, see-through getup, as she paired the high-end look with a taupe shawl and designer high heels.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While Vanessa appeared to opt out of a brassiere, the bold choice is on brand for the beauty. “Free the nipple! Bras are uncomfortable,” she said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Glamour UK</a>&nbsp;magazine, which was part of their Dec. 2021 cover story. “If you feel more comfortable and ready to take on the world in a bra, then by all means wear one. But for me personally, they’re just&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>not comfortable</a>. I don’t want to feel restricted.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Women used to have to be more covered up,” the actress added, pointing out how the attitude towards playing demure has changed over the years. “And I feel like it’s a lot more accepting of women to express themselves how they feel fit,” she explained.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Meanwhile, the star has been going from strength to strength with 25-year-old, MLB player boyfriend&nbsp;<strong>Cole Tucker</strong>. &nbsp;A few months ago, an insider told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong>&nbsp;EXCLUSIVELY that their relationship&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>is better than ever!</a>&nbsp;“Cole treats Vanessa like a queen, he adores her,” the source said. “He has been very serious about her from the get-go and that has not wavered. He adores her and says all the time that she is his dream girl, it’s sweet.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5FuZq%2BZnprAtK2Moaydn5WjwG68yKeiZp%2BfrLtuvs6mnGaomKTBsL%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
