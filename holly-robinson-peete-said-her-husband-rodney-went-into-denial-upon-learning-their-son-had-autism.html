According to Robinson, her husband was in denial. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKSOvlVZvr8">She said:</a></p><p class=dh>"My husband went into denial, and we really struggled."</p><p class=dh>Robinson tried her best to get her husband to be on board so they could begin to work on a solution together, but that didn't work, and it almost caused a strain in their marriage.</p><p class=dh>As much as he didn't like the situation, he had to step up for his family and accept his son for who he is.

He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VctZ3O-sefQ">said he just wanted to be normal</a> like everyone else.</p><p class=dh>At the early stages of his diagnosis, it seemed like RJ was never going to be able to work or gain meaningful employment. Now, however, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/actress-holly-robinson-peete-on-how-to-get-the-best-care-for-a-child-with-special-needs-175648322.html>he has beaten the odds.</a></p><p class=dh>RJ plays the piano, participates in sports and currently works as a Los Angeles Dodgers field house attendant, which is his dream job.</p><p class=dh>Robinson said she feels very blessed because of how much her son has progressed, especially in areas she was told he would never measure up.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Through their own experience, the Peetes have been able to reach out to others in similar situations.</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/ba34453b2d4aac1ed1aadc46a369bf8b.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Holly Robinson Peete speaks onstage during the HollyRod Foundation's 21st Annual DesignCare Gala on July 27, 2019 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HE HAD A SUPPORT SYSTEM</strong></p><p class=dh>RJ's parents and loved ones were the best support system he could ever ask for.

Robinson said she didn't see a lot of people advocating for autism awareness.</p><p class=dh>She decided to take that step with the help of her husband. From their experience having a child with Autism, the Peetes knew that it wasn't just emotionally draining.</p><p class=dh>It was also very expensive, and so they both joined hands and created the Hollyrod foundation to assist parents of autistic children in getting all the services they need.</p><p class=dh>With the platform of reality TV, they were also able to share RJ's story with the world through the reality show, "Meet the Peetes."</p><p class=dh>Robinson also went to have a talk <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/health/holly-robinson-peete-son-autism-diagnosis-life-now/>with PEOPLE and shared the story</a> of her son, and as she wanted, the story made an impact. She was approached by people who told her the article made them hopeful.</p><p class=dh>Through their own experience, the Peetes have been able to reach out to others in similar situations. Compared to when they first heard of Autism, there is now a lot more awareness about the condition.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MEET THE WHOLE FAMILY</strong></p><p class=dh>In the month of June, in the year 1995, Robinson married her husband and the father of her children, Rodney Peete, a national football league quarterback.</p><p class=dh>Since then, they have raised a family together.
