Posting from Texas, Tracey wishes her followers to have a happy Easter, and also to keep safe at home. On the post <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-5jAepp8me/>she wrote:</a></p><p class=fh>“Happy Easter Fam! Hoping you and yours are safe, healthy, and AT PEACE today! Let’s all stay smart and cautious, but HAVE NO FEAR... BETTER DAYS ARE COMING SOON! Quarantining with my ❤️@deionsanders and sending you LOVE from TEXAS!”</p><p><h3 class=kh><strong class=dh>8 YEARS AND COUNTING</strong></h3></p><p class=fh>Busyness woman and producer, Tracey Edmonds, and former NFL player and sports analyzer, Deion Sanders, have been together for more than 8 years. <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://madamenoire.com/1061025/deion-sanders-tracey-edmonds/>Their relationship</a> has had many ups and downs like any other, but they have known how to cope with that.</p><p class=fh>According to the former football player growth, distance, and their kids were <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://madamenoire.com/1066426/deion-sanders-tracey-edmonds-engagement/>major factors </a>for both to wait the right time to get engaged. Work and travel schedules, besides the children they have separately from different marriages, were important issues on this decision.</p><p class=fh>Tracey and Deion have been dating since 2012. <a class="Ed a" href=#>Tracey</a> has been married for 12 years to singer Babyface until 2005, with whom she shares two sons. Meanwhile, Deion has two children from his marriage to Carolyn Chambers, and three other children with Pilar Biggers-Sanders, who was his wife from 1999 to 2013.</p><p class=fh><a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://madamenoire.com/1066426/deion-sanders-tracey-edmonds-engagement/>On an interview</a>, Deion once said over his engagement announcement after 8 years together:</p><p class=fh>"Well, kids play a major role, and I didn’t believe in long-distance marriages (...) so there’s gonna have to be sacrifices made on both sides. And oftentimes one is not willing to make sacrifices, but one must grow.”</p><p class=fh>It is not unusual to see any of them <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BQgD-SggjiZ/>posting videos</a> and photos to show the love they have. They look up to each other in equal terms, and they feel they are ready to take the next step in their relationship. But no big wedding party this time!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtnbWhkanq1vsCcnLJllZm6sLrDrGSfoZGjsKZ5w56gqKZdqK6vsMSrqmafnKTEb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
