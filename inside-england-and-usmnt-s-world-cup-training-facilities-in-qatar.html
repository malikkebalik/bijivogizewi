There are several food and drinks outlets which are open despite not many people being around.</p><p>They cater to drive-through visitors who pull up in their air-conditioned vehicles to grab a sandwich or an iced coffee in the heat of the day. One coffee stand is staffed by Filipino workers Cecile and Kane.</p><p>Kane, of course, shares her name with England captain Harry who will soon be practising on the pitch just behind her stall. Initially, she says she hasn’t heard of him, though after being shown a photograph she unconvincingly suggests he might look familiar. She is not a big football fan, preferring basketball, like many of her compatriots.</p><p>The two women have no idea that the <a href=#>England team</a> will be coming here, but they did watch a match recently in one of Qatar’s new stadiums after tournament organisers doled out free tickets to locals to test the facilities.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/09/19101412/20220704_150749-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Cecile and Kane work in a coffee stand near the Saoud bin Abdulrahman Stadium</span><p>Qataris make up a small minority of the population of a country which has imported labour on a vast scale in recent years to prepare for the World Cup. Impressive as the transformation might be, it has come at a human cost. Migrant workers from many countries have been exploited, injured and, in the worst cases, lost their lives.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The Saoud bin Abdulrahman Stadium is not one of the new developments, but an older, smaller facility. It is usually home to Al Wakrah SC, who came third in last season’s Qatar Stars League and won it in 1999 and 2001.</p><p>Few of the team’s current players will be familiar outside the Middle East, but former stars include World Cup winner Frank Leboeuf, who played 10 games for the club in 2004-05; former <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Premier League</a> players Youssef Chippo and Alain Goma; and journeyman striker Alan Waddle, cousin of England legend <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Chris</a>, who had a brief spell here in 1986.</p><p>The site has training facilities and a gym. There is table football in the corridors. There is also a canteen with plastic chairs and garish wallpaper with a big screen which may soon be used for tactical instructions.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/11/11133425/20220704_152128-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>The facility is equipped with table football</span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/09/19124217/20220704_152422-scaled-e1663605858993.jpg alt width=1829 height=1376 sizes="(max-width: 1829px) 100vw, 1829px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>The big screen in the canteen</span><p>It is all very pleasant, but not luxurious, and will be a far cry from the facilities at Premier League clubs, although things may look very different now compared to in summer when there was still building work being done.</p><p>Qatar is just 100 miles from top to bottom, making it by far the smallest country ever to host a World Cup.</p><p>The vast majority of the population lives in the capital Doha, with seven of the eight stadiums accessible on the Doha Metro system. The eighth, Al Bayt, is just a 25-minute drive from the nearest Metro stop.</p><p>All but two of the World Cup teams will be based in and around Doha.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/10/26101803/QatarStadiums_Map.png alt width=4167 height=4167 sizes="(max-width: 4167px) 100vw, 4167px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>An exception to the Doha cluster is Germany. The 2014 winners are heading to the Zulal Wellness Resort on the country’s northern tip, an 80-minute drive north of the capital.</p><p><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Belgium</a> were initially envious about their European rival’s training camp, figuring it would be better to travel a bit further for each match for the benefit of a combined hotel and training base.</p><p>Roberto Martinez’s side eventually found another option at the Hilton Salwa in the country’s south west region, a short distance from Qatar’s border with Saudi Arabia, a country that has also qualified for the tournament.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The bases were allocated according to a first-come-first-served preference system, and each training base and hotel had to be approved by <a class=ath_autolink href=#>FIFA</a>’s independent monitoring service.</p><p>Teams were asked to put in first, second and third options, and whoever asks for the first option first and qualified quickest got allocated their pick.</p><p>This does not rule out last-minute chaos — in 2018, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Brazil</a> changed their minds a week before. It did not help them, crashing out 2-1 to Belgium in the quarter-finals, four years on from the humiliating 7-1 home defeat to <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Germany</a> in the semi-final.</p><p>Every federation has a different thought process — be it cost, proximity to the city versus space, or even superstition — some nations won’t state their preferred base before they qualify in case they “jinx” it.</p><p>Getting away from the hustle and bustle of central Doha is appealing to some.</p><p>That’s very much the case for England’s team hotel, the Souq Al Wakra Hotel Qatar by Tivoli, on the shore of the Persian Gulf, a short drive from the stadium at which they will train.</p><p>When The Athletic visits, we are welcomed inside by staff and can take photos despite turning up unannounced.</p><p>The place is luxurious with separate low-rise lodges giving players lots of space to relax in between training sessions and matches.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/09/19124851/20220704_161228-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>England’s luxurious World Cup hotel</span><p>There are wellness rooms, a well-equipped gym, and the hotel opens straight onto a glorious sandy beach. Fans hoping to share breakfast with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Harry Kane</a> or <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Raheem Sterling</a> will be disappointed — rooms have been unavailable to book for months.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/11/11124401/20220704_161825-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>The beach just outside England’s World Cup hotel</span><p>This is a “dry” hotel. The topic of alcohol has been endlessly debated in the run-up to the tournament, with many restrictions governing its sale in Qatar.</p><p>Those who want a drink will not find it impossible but things will be different to other tournaments. Alcohol is readily available in hotel bars but not served outside them, for example in restaurants or at the airport. There will be a fan zone in central Bidda Park where alcohol will be served, though at limited times.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/11/11124446/20220704_160908-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Inside England’s team hotel for the World Cup</span><p>Even in this relaxed, glamorous setting, it is hard to escape the big questions hanging over this World Cup — an investigation by the Guardian earlier this year found security guards working in Doha who had paid extortionate recruitment fees and were working 12-hour shifts for just £1 ($1.18) an hour.</p><p>A half-hour drive to the north on the other side of the Doha suburbs is another stadium; this one somewhat larger but looking fairly similar from the outside to the one where England will train.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>With the SUVs parking up to get drive-through iced coffee, the wide freeways stretching out into the desert and the suffocating summer heat, the western outskirts of Doha feel a little like the USA’s dusty South West.</p><p>If you squint and ignore the mosques, as well as the signs in Arabic as well as English, you could be in Arizona.</p><p>The Thani bin Jassim Stadium is where the US Men’s National Team (USMNT) will train before taking on Wales, England and Iran in Group B.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/09/19130010/20220706_102300-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>The Thani bin Jassim Stadium, USMNT’s training base</span><p>The stadium is usually home to Al-Gharafa, another <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Qatar</a> Stars League team with an illustrious past, winning seven league titles, though not since 2010. Famous names to have played for the club include 1998 World Cup winner Marcel Desailly, Netherlands star Wesley Sneijder and Costa Rica legend Paulo Wanchope. Current players include Gabriel Pires, on loan from Benfica, and Jonathan Kodjia, formerly of <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Aston Villa</a> and Bristol City.</p><p>The stadium will presumably be heavily guarded when the USMNT arrive, but in July it is easy to walk off the street, uninvited and unannounced, and look around the stadium and its buildings.</p><p>Although the Middle East is in constant turmoil, Qatar is a generally safe country and the US military has its biggest regional military presence at the huge Al Udeid Air Base just 30 minutes from the stadium.</p><p>There is an indoor sports centre on the same site and facilities include a big gym (above), offices and rest areas. There’s also a tactics board with rows of chairs from which players can listen to coach Gregg Berhalter’s instructions. With swish marble floors and lots of space inside, the surroundings are notably grander than those at Al Wakrah, though the medical room was in need of some work back in July.</p><p><img width=300 height=225 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/11/11130754/20220706_104829-300x225.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img width=300 height=225 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/11/11130806/20220706_104830-300x225.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/09/19130319/20220706_103850-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>The medical room at the stadium was incomplete back when The Athletic visited in July</span><p>Just to the north of Doha is Lusail, a “planned city” mapped out and built over the last two decades, with a spectacular skyline befitting of a science-fiction film.</p><p>The stop before Lusail on the gleaming Doha Metro is Qatar University.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Visiting at the height of summer there is almost nobody here and the car parks sit empty beneath elevated train tracks heading back towards Doha as well as towards the new Lusail Stadium.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/10/21123242/20220706_171200-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Outside Qatar University</span><p>The university is huge and the facilities are new and shiny, though this time a security guard does not let The Athletic freely wander around the indoor facilities.</p><p>This eerie site will soon be playing host to arguably the world’s greatest-ever footballer, as an Argentina side captained by <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Lionel Messi</a> will be based here for the tournament.
