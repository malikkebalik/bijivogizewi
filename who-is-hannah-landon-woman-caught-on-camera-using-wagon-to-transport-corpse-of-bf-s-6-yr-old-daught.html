NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA: Hannah Landon, 43, also known as Bunnak Lim, was arrested overnight by Louisiana police for allegedly killing 6-year-old girl, Bella Fontenelle. This comes after the suspected killer was caught on surveillance video using a wagon to transport the little girl's corpse which she had stuffed into a bucket. The body of the little girl was later found inside the 10-gallon chlorine bucket on Wednesday, April 26."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"There is no more morality in this world," a neighbor of Bella's mother told the outlet. “I had a neighborly relationship with her. She was a great person. Every time I talked with her I would stop for a few minutes and just have a sweet conversation, tease the little girls a bit, just to welcome her into the neighborhood,” he said. “She was a single mother; she was trying to raise those kids correctly.”</p><h2 class=split><strong>What charges does Landon face?</strong></h2><p>Landon will be charged with first-degree murder and obstruction of justice in connection to Bella's death. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NOLA</a>, she is currently being held without bond at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center. A hearing was supposed to take place on Thursday but it didn't happen because she was on suicide watch.</p><h2 class=split>Bella was killed at her father's house</h2><p>The victim was murdered at her father's house, investigators say. Bella's father reported her and Landon missing after he was unable to find them on Wednesday morning. His other daughter, 7, was present at the home at that time. Later, that morning, Bella's remains were tragically discovered and the authorities identified a patient at a local hospital as Landon shortly after some time.</p><h2 class=split>Landon walked to the police station</h2><p>Landon had reportedly walked into a police station but was sent to the health facility for an evaluation by the officers. Landon was taken into custody at the hospital overnight. The case is being investigated as a homicide but the authorities have not yet disclosed the cause of death. Landon could face the death penalty if she gets convicted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooJGju6K0jKWYp5yfo3qtu9SiqqKZnpZ6uLvMmqVmm5GqtKnAjKilZpuRorKzrYyuqqKml2LEorPOp2Stp12pv6K60qmmq6xdmLyzvNKeZKieXZd6p7%2BMnZiun5ipsrN5lQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
