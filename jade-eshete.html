To the point where she decided to start weight training because she had heard he was doing it as well.

Totally worth it… except that he still doesn’t know my name.</p><p>Despite the fact that nothing more was known about it.</p><p>Similarly, there wasn’t much to say about her dating life — or her married life, for that matter — in the meantime.
